# Scholar Journal Formatting and Submission

You are an expert in academic publishing, familiar with submission requirements, editorial emphases, and open science standards of top sociology, demography, linguistics, political science, and multidisciplinary journals.

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse:
- **Target journal**: ASR / AJS / Demography / Du Bois Review / Science Advances / NHB / NCS / Social Forces / Language in Society / J. Sociolinguistics / Linguistic Inquiry / Gender & Society / APSR / JMF / PDR / SMR / Poetics / PNAS / other
- **Paper type**: research article / research note / letter / brief report / methods article
- **Mode**: FULL-PACKAGE / FORMAT-CHECK / COVER-LETTER / SELECT-JOURNAL / RESUBMIT-PACKAGE
- **Paper description** (for SELECT-JOURNAL and COVER-LETTER): topic, methods, main finding

If no mode specified: run **FULL-PACKAGE** when a journal is named; run **SELECT-JOURNAL** when no journal is named.

---

## Setup

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/submission" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs"
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-journal-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-journal-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-journal --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-journal-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-journal
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

---

## Step 0: Dispatch

| Mode keyword | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `full`, `prepare`, `submission`, no mode given + journal named | FULL-PACKAGE → Steps 1–8 |
| `format`, `check`, `audit` | FORMAT-CHECK → Steps 2–3 + Step 7 checklist |
| `cover letter`, `cover` | COVER-LETTER → Steps 1 + 5 |
| `select`, `which journal`, `target`, no journal named | SELECT-JOURNAL → Step 1 only |
| `resubmit`, `R&R`, `rejection`, `revise and resubmit` | RESUBMIT-PACKAGE → Steps 1 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 8 |

---

## Step 1: Journal Selection and Scoring

**If mode = SELECT-JOURNAL**, score the paper against all target journals. If a journal is already named, skip to Step 2.

### Journal Selection Scoring Rubric (8 dimensions)

Score each candidate journal 1–5 on each dimension, then sum for a ranked list.

| Dimension | Score 1 | Score 5 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Scope fit** | Paper outside journal scope | Perfect scope match |
| **Methods fit** | Methods below current journal standard | Methods are exactly what journal publishes |
| **Theory fit** | Atheoretical or theory mismatch | Theory is at center of argument |
| **Word count fit** | Paper is 2,000+ words over limit | Paper fits within limit |
| **Prestige target** | Paper not competitive at that tier | Paper is competitive |
| **Open science readiness** | Missing data/code; not preregistered | Data + code + preregistration all present |
| **Turnaround priority** | Fastest turnaround less important | Fastest turnaround critical |
| **Audience breadth** | Narrow disciplinary audience | Cross-disciplinary appeal |

### Quick Selection Guide

## Step 2: Manuscript Audit

Audit the manuscript against the target journal's requirements. Ask the user for (or infer from $ARGUMENTS):
- Current word count (total + by section if available)
- Current citation style
- Number of tables and figures
- Whether preregistered / data available / code available

**Word Count Audit** (approximate section allocation):

| Section | ASR/AJS (~12k) | Demography (~10k) | Science Advances (~5k) | NHB (~4k) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Introduction | 600–900 | 500–700 | 400–600 | 400–600 |
| Theory/Background | 1,500–2,500 | 1,000–1,500 | embedded in intro | embedded |
| Data & Methods | 1,500–2,500 | 2,000–3,000 | 700–1,200 | 800–1,200 |
| Results | 2,500–4,000 | 2,500–4,000 | 1,200–2,000 | 800–1,500 |
| Discussion/Conclusion | 1,000–1,500 | 800–1,200 | 600–1,000 | 600–900 |

## Step 6b: Pre-Submission Cross-Skill Integration Checks

**Pre-submission integration checks**:
1. Invoke `scholar-citation` MODE 2 (AUDIT) — verify all citations are consistent
2. Invoke `scholar-citation` MODE 3 (CONVERT-STYLE) — ensure citation style matches target journal
3. Check: Does manuscript include Data/Code Availability statement? If not, flag.
4. Check: Does manuscript include Author Contributions (CRediT)? If targeting Nature family, flag if missing.
5. Check: Does manuscript include Competing Interests declaration? Flag if missing for Nature family.
6. **Invoke `scholar-verify` (full mode)** — run the 4-agent verification panel as a pre-submission gate:

   ```bash
   cat .claude/skills/scholar-verify/SKILL.md
   ```

   Run `scholar-verify full` on the manuscript being submitted. This catches:
   - **Stage 1**: Raw analysis outputs that don't match manuscript tables/figures (transcription errors introduced during formatting)
   - **Stage 2**: Statistical claims in prose that don't match manuscript tables/figures (misquoted numbers, wrong references, significance errors)

   **Gate rule**: If the verification verdict is **MAJOR ISSUES — DO NOT SUBMIT**, halt submission prep and report the fix checklist. The user must resolve all CRITICAL issues before proceeding to Step 7 (compliance checklist). If verdict is REVISIONS NEEDED or READY, proceed with any CRITICAL fixes applied and WARNINGS noted in the submission readiness report (Step 8).

## Step 8: Save Output

Use the **Write tool** to save the submission package files.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [values] with actuals before running
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# BASE pattern: ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/submission/scholar-journal-report-[journal]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
# Split into directory and stem for the gate script:
OUTDIR="$(dirname "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/submission/scholar-journal-report-[journal]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/submission/scholar-journal-report-[journal]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file (cover letter, open science declarations). The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).
