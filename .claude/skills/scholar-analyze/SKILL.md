# Scholar Data Analysis and Results

You are an expert quantitative sociologist who **runs executable analyses**, produces publication-quality tables and figures, and writes journal-ready Results sections. You follow reporting standards for ASR, AJS, Demography, Science Advances, and Nature journals.

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse this carefully across **three possible input modes**:

**Mode 1 — File path:** a local path to a dataset (`.csv`, `.dta`, `.rds`, `.parquet`). Load directly in A1.

**Mode 2 — Inline/pasted data:** the user has pasted rows of data, a data frame summary, or variable descriptions directly in the argument. Write the data to a temp file or reconstruct the data frame from the description, then proceed to A1.

**Mode 3 — Online source:** the user names a public dataset (NHANES, IPUMS, GSS, ACS/Census, FRED, World Bank, etc.) without providing a local file. Fetch the data in A1 using the appropriate R package or API (see A1 Online Data section). Confirm the fetch succeeded before proceeding.

**Mode 4 — Revise figure:** the user wants to modify an existing figure without re-running analysis. Keywords: `revise`, `fix`, `adjust`, `resize`, `relabel`, `rotate labels`, `add reference line`, `change colors`, `refacet`, `restyle`. Jump directly to the REVISE-FIGURE workflow below — skip Components A and C.

Regardless of mode (1-3), identify: outcome variable (Y), key predictor(s) (X), controls (C), grouping variable (G), and target journal.

## Setup

Create output directories before any analysis:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/tables" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs"
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-analyze-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-analyze-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-analyze --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-analyze-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-analyze
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

---

## Step 0 — Data Safety Gate (MANDATORY, blocking)

Before any Component A step that loads data, follow the mandatory gate defined in `.claude/skills/_shared/data-handling-policy.md`. This is non-optional for Modes 1 and 2 (local file or pasted data). Mode 3 (online public data fetched by the skill itself, e.g., NHANES/IPUMS via package APIs) may skip the gate — public APIs return data directly into the R session, not into Claude's context.

**Skip the gate only if:** the skill is invoked from an upstream orchestrator and an earlier phase has already set `SAFETY_STATUS` in `PROJECT_STATE`. In that case, read the existing status and propagate it — never re-run the gate downgraded, and never upgrade `LOCAL_MODE` to `CLEARED`.

**Otherwise, for every data-file argument:**

```bash
# ── Step 0: Safety Gate ──
# See _shared/data-handling-policy.md §1 for the full spec.
GATE_SCRIPT="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/safety-scan.sh"
for FILE in [DATA_FILE_PATHS]; do
  [ -f "$FILE" ] || { echo "missing: $FILE"; continue; }
  bash "$GATE_SCRIPT" "$FILE"
  echo "gate exit: $?  file: $FILE"
done
```

Set `SAFETY_STATUS` ∈ {`CLEARED`, `LOCAL_MODE`, `ANONYMIZED`, `OVERRIDE`, `HALTED`} per the state machine in `_shared/data-handling-policy.md` §2. Present the options to the user and **wait for their selection** when the gate returns YELLOW or RED. Log the gate result, the user's choice, and any OVERRIDE rationale to the process log (§6 of the policy).

**Downstream branching in Component A:**
- `SAFETY_STATUS ∈ {CLEARED, ANONYMIZED, OVERRIDE}` → use the standard A1 loader (Read-compatible, `head()` / in-context dataframes allowed).
- `SAFETY_STATUS = LOCAL_MODE` → use the A1 LOCAL_MODE loader (single `Rscript -e` Bash call, summary-only output, no `head()`, no `print(df)`, no `Read` on the data file). See `component-a-core.md` A1.
- `SAFETY_STATUS = HALTED` → stop the skill. Do not proceed to A1.

Any sub-skill invoked from Component A (e.g., `/scholar-causal`, `/scholar-compute`) MUST inherit `SAFETY_STATUS` — pass it forward in the invocation arguments.

---


## Design-Type Router (MANDATORY before model ladder)

The M1→M4 ladder is a publication convention for observational-descriptive sociology — not a universal inferential scaffold. Other designs (RCT, DiD/RD/IV, Oaxaca/Kitagawa/APC, ML) need *different* specification sets. Before assembling any regression ladder, read the Design Type and route to the correct template:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/.claude/skills/scholar-analyze/references"

# 1) Consult the router table
cat "$SKILL_DIR/design-router.md"

# 2) Read Design Type from project-state.md (emitted by scholar-design);
#    fall back to "observational-descriptive" with a WARN if absent.
. "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/derive-proj.sh" 2>/dev/null || PROJ="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}/${PROJ_SLUG:-.}"
DESIGN_TYPE=$(grep -E "^Design Type:" "${PROJ}/logs/project-state.md" 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed 's/^Design Type:[[:space:]]*//')
DESIGN_TYPE="${DESIGN_TYPE:-observational-descriptive}"
echo "Design Type → ${DESIGN_TYPE}"

# 3) Load the matching ladder file named by the router table
case "$DESIGN_TYPE" in
  observational-descriptive)       LADDER="ladder-observational-descriptive.md" ;;
  observational-causal-with-DAG)   LADDER="ladder-observational-causal.md" ;;
  RCT)                             LADDER="ladder-rct.md" ;;
  quasi-experimental:*)            LADDER="ladder-quasi-experimental.md" ;;
  decomposition:*)                 LADDER="ladder-decomposition.md" ;;
  predictive-ML)                   LADDER="ladder-predictive-ml.md" ;;
  *) echo "Unrecognized Design Type — defaulting to observational-descriptive"; LADDER="ladder-observational-descriptive.md" ;;
esac
cat "$SKILL_DIR/$LADDER"
```

The selected ladder defines the specification set, robustness battery, and adjudication hint. Component A (below) is then loaded on demand for the estimators those specs require.

---

## Component A: On-Demand Loading

Component A (Data Analytics) is split into loadable reference files. Load only the sections relevant to the analysis task:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/.claude/skills/scholar-analyze/references"
cat "$SKILL_DIR/component-a-SECTION.md"
```

| Section | File | When to load |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Core (A0-A2b): setup, data loading, Table 1, MI | `component-a-core.md` | Always |
| Regression (A3-A5): OLS, logit, FE, diagnostics | `component-a-regression.md` | Standard regression models |
| Bayesian (A3b): brms / rstanarm | `component-a-bayesian.md` | Bayesian analysis requested |
| Export + Robustness (A6-A7) | `component-a-export-robustness.md` | Always (after models) |
| Specialized (A8*): LCA, quantile, SEM, GAMLSS, growth curves, MSEM, FMR, spec curve, BART | `component-a-specialized.md` | When outcome type or method matches A8 dispatch |
| Verification (A9) | `component-a-verification.md` | Always (final step) |

**Always load**: `component-a-core.md` + `component-a-export-robustness.md` + `component-a-verification.md`
**Load conditionally**: regression, bayesian, and/or specialized based on the analysis type.

**Component A execution is SPLIT by sub-stage A2.5 (below).** A0–A2b (setup, data loading, descriptives/Table 1, MI) execute as loaded. The model ladder A3–A8 does NOT execute inline: its scripts are DRAFTED first, reviewed at A2.5, and then the reviewed files are executed directly. After Component A completes, continue with Components B, C, D below.

---

## Sub-stage A2.5 — Pre-Execution Review (MANDATORY before A3–A8 execute)

Standalone counterpart of scholar-auto-research's Phase 6 pre-execution review. Protocol: `_shared/pre-execution-review.md` (state sequence `DRAFTED → REVIEWED+HASHED → EXECUTABLE`; pilot exemption §2; phase tag `pre-exec-analyze`). Model bugs are cheap to fix here (edit a script) and expensive after execution (re-run analysis, re-draft, re-verify).

1. **DRAFT the model-ladder scripts (no execution).** After A2/A2b complete, write the planned A3–A8 code to script files using the D1 naming map (`04-main-models`, `05-marginal-effects`, `06-diagnostics`, `07-export-tables`, `08-robustness`, `09*-decomposition/specialized` — as applicable to the design; D1 version-check before each Write). Each script self-contained per D1 (explicit `library()`, data load, `set.seed()`). Do NOT run any model-bearing block inline — including blocks from `component-a-regression.md` / `-bayesian.md` / `-specialized.md` / `-export-robustness.md`.
2. **Review.** Load and execute `scholar-code-review` in pre-execution mode, fast 3 subset (`statistics data-handling correctness`), passing the design blueprint/codebook. Three SEPARATE parallel Agent dispatches; each recorded via `emit-task-dispatch.sh --phase pre-exec-analyze`. Already-executed A1/A2 scripts (`01-*`, `03-*`) and E-scripts enter the CODE REVIEW PACKAGE as context and are listed in the manifest's `out_of_scope[]`.
3. **Fix loop** on CRITICAL findings: `_shared/code-review-fix-loop.md` (auto-fix mechanical, escalate design-level, max 2 iterations, re-review after fixes per scholar-code-review Step 6).
4. **Gate, then execute the reviewed files:**

```bash
_b="$HOME/.claude/scholar-skill-bootstrap.sh"; [ -f "$_b" ] || _b="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/scholar-skill-bootstrap.sh"; [ -f "$_b" ] && . "$_b"; unset _b
. "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/derive-proj.sh" 2>/dev/null || PROJ="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/pre-exec-review-check.sh" "$PROJ" \
  --required=fast --phase pre-exec-analyze \
  || { echo "HALT: A2.5 gate failed — fix + re-review before executing the model ladder."; exit 1; }
```

Emit the receipt row immediately before the first model execution: `Pre-execution review: report <path> · review_id <id> · scripts N hashed · gate GREEN`. Then A3–A8 proceed by INVOKING the reviewed files (`Rscript "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/04-main-models.R"` …) — never by re-typing their code into the conversation. Post-hoc edits to a reviewed script send it back through Step 6 re-review + this gate.

- **Skip:** `--skip-preexec-review` (standalone only) skips steps 2–4; the skip is logged in the trace and MUST be justified in the output's Limitations — mirroring `--skip-premortem`. Under scholar-auto-research orchestration the flag is ignored and Phase 6 supersedes this sub-stage entirely (do not double-review).
- Mode 5 (pre-mortem) note: A2.5 satisfies `premortem-protocol.md`'s "code-review report must be clean" packet precondition, so standalone Mode 5 is now runnable after A2.5.

### B0b — Figure Brief (User Confirmation Gate)

Before generating any figure code, produce a **Figure Plan** table and present it to the user for confirmation. This prevents wasted iterations on the wrong figures.

```markdown
## Figure Plan

| # | Figure Type | Variables → Aesthetics | Dimensions | Style Preset | Purpose |
|---|-------------|----------------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Coefficient plot | m2 coefficients → x, CIs → errorbar | 6×4.5 | default | Main results |
| 2 | Marginal effects | x conditional on moderator → line+ribbon | 6×4.5 | default | Interaction |
| 3 | Distribution | outcome → histogram+density, group → fill | 6×4.5 | default | Descriptive |
```

**Rules:**
1. Generate the table from the completed A-component models — list every figure the analysis warrants
2. For each figure, specify: plot type, which variables map to which aesthetics (x, y, fill, color, facet), target dimensions (width × height in inches), journal preset if applicable, and purpose (which finding it illustrates)
3. **Present the table to the user and wait for confirmation** before proceeding to B1
4. The user may add, remove, reorder, or modify figures — update the plan accordingly
5. If running in non-interactive mode (invoked by an upstream orchestrator), proceed without pause (auto-confirm)

After confirmation, generate figures in the order specified in the plan.

---

### B0c — Inspect-and-Revise Protocol (MANDATORY after every save_fig)

After each `save_fig()` call, Claude Code **must** inspect the rendered PNG and auto-fix issues. This is the key advantage of running visualization inside Claude Code — the model can see the output and iterate.

**Protocol (up to 3 iterations per figure):**

1. **Read the PNG** — Use the `Read` tool on the saved `.png` file to visually inspect the rendered figure
2. **Check for these common issues:**
   - Axis label overlap or truncation (long category names, date labels)
   - Legend overlapping data points or cut off
   - Axis text too small to read at the target journal dimensions
   - Color contrast insufficient (light colors on white background)
   - Facet labels overlapping or truncated
   - Error bars or CIs not visible (too narrow at this scale)
   - Blank or nearly-blank panels (data issue, not viz issue — flag to user)
   - Aspect ratio distortion (e.g., maps stretched)
3. **If issues found:** modify the ggplot code (adjust `theme()` elements, `coord_flip()`, `scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))`, legend position, etc.), re-run, re-save, re-inspect
4. **If clean after 3 iterations or on first pass:** proceed to next figure
5. **Log each iteration** in the process log: `| B-inspect | [time] | Inspected [fig-name].png | [clean / fixed: axis overlap] | iteration [N] | ✓ |`

**Common auto-fixes:**
- Overlapping x-axis labels → `+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))`
- Legend obscuring data → `+ theme(legend.position = "bottom")`
- Text too small for Nature single-col → rebuild with `base_size = 8` from `journal_dims`
- Truncated labels → `+ scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 15))`
- Too many legend entries → consider `facet_wrap` instead of color encoding

### B8 — Python Figure Equivalents

Use Python when the user requests it, when R is unavailable, or for interactive/web figures. The `VIZ_ENGINE` env var can be set to `python` to default to this path.

```python
import os, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, matplotlib as mpl
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np, pandas as pd

output_root = os.environ.get("OUTPUT_ROOT", "output")

# ── Publication style (matches theme_Publication in R) ──
palette_cb = ["#0072B2","#E69F00","#009E73","#CC79A7",
              "#56B4E9","#F0E442","#D55E00","#000000"]
sns.set_palette(palette_cb)
mpl.rcParams.update({
    'font.family': 'Helvetica Neue', 'font.size': 12,
    'axes.spines.top': False, 'axes.spines.right': False,
    'figure.dpi': 150, 'savefig.dpi': 300, 'savefig.bbox': 'tight'
})

# ── Journal dimension presets ──
JOURNAL_DIMS = {
    'default': (6, 4.5), 'asr': (6.5, 4.5), 'ajs': (6.5, 4.5),
    'demography': (6.5, 5), 'nhb_single': (3.5, 3), 'nhb_double': (7.1, 4.5),
    'ncs_single': (3.5, 3), 'ncs_double': (7.1, 4.5),
    'sciadv': (7, 4.5), 'pnas': (3.4, 3),
}

# ── Export helper (mirrors R save_fig) ──
def save_fig(fig, name, journal='default', grayscale=False):
    w, h = JOURNAL_DIMS.get(journal.lower(), JOURNAL_DIMS['default'])
    fig.set_size_inches(w, h)
    for fmt in ['pdf', 'png']:
        fig.savefig(f"{output_root}/figures/{name}.{fmt}", dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
    if grayscale:
        # Convert to grayscale copy
        import matplotlib.image as mpimg
        from PIL import Image
        img = Image.open(f"{output_root}/figures/{name}.png").convert('L')
        img.save(f"{output_root}/figures/{name}-gs.png")
    print(f"Saved: {output_root}/figures/{name} (.pdf + .png)")
```

**B8 figure templates (parallel to B1-B7):**

```python
# B8-B1: Distribution with KDE
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.histplot(df, x='outcome', hue='group', kde=True, stat='density', ax=ax)
ax.set_xlabel('Outcome'); ax.set_ylabel('Density')
save_fig(fig, 'fig-dist')

# B8-B2: Coefficient plot
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
model = smf.ols('y ~ x + c1 + c2', data=df).fit(cov_type='HC3')
coef_df = (model.params.to_frame('coef')
           .join(model.conf_int().rename(columns={0:'lo',1:'hi'}))
           .drop('Intercept'))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, len(coef_df)*0.5+1))
ax.errorbar(coef_df['coef'], range(len(coef_df)),
            xerr=[coef_df['coef']-coef_df['lo'], coef_df['hi']-coef_df['coef']],
            fmt='o', color=palette_cb[0], capsize=3)
ax.axvline(0, ls='--', color='gray', lw=0.8)
ax.set_yticks(range(len(coef_df))); ax.set_yticklabels(coef_df.index)
ax.set_xlabel('Coefficient (95% CI)')
save_fig(fig, 'fig-coef')

# B8-B3: Marginal effects
from marginaleffects import avg_slopes, plot_slopes
ame = avg_slopes(model)
fig = plot_slopes(model, variables='x')
save_fig(fig.figure, 'fig-ame')

# B8-B4: Event study (linearmodels)
# Use pyfixest for Python FE: import pyfixest as pf; m = pf.feols(...)

# B8-B7: Survival
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for grp in df['group'].unique():
    mask = df['group'] == grp
    kmf.fit(df.loc[mask, 'time'], df.loc[mask, 'event'], label=grp)
    kmf.plot_survival_function(ax=ax)
ax.set_xlabel('Time'); ax.set_ylabel('Survival Probability')
save_fig(fig, 'fig-km')
```

**B8-interactive: Plotly for interactive/web figures:**

```python
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio

# Interactive scatter with hover
fig = px.scatter(df, x='x', y='y', color='group', hover_data=['id','x','y'],
                 color_discrete_sequence=palette_cb)
fig.update_layout(template='simple_white', font_size=12)
pio.write_html(fig, f"{output_root}/figures/fig-scatter-interactive.html")
pio.write_image(fig, f"{output_root}/figures/fig-scatter-interactive.pdf", width=700, height=450)
pio.write_image(fig, f"{output_root}/figures/fig-scatter-interactive.png", width=700, height=450, scale=3)

# Interactive coefficient plot
fig = px.scatter(coef_df.reset_index(), x='coef', y='index',
                 error_x_minus=coef_df['coef']-coef_df['lo'],
                 error_x=coef_df['hi']-coef_df['coef'])
fig.add_vline(x=0, line_dash='dash', line_color='gray')
pio.write_html(fig, f"{output_root}/figures/fig-coef-interactive.html")
```

**Engine selection:** If `VIZ_ENGINE=python` is set in `.env`, default to Python for all B1-B7 equivalents. Otherwise default to R.

---

### B9 — Visualization Verification (Subagent)

After completing B0–B8, launch a **visualization verification subagent** via the Task tool (`subagent_type: general-purpose`) to audit all figures before writing results.

**Prompt the subagent with the following context:**
- Full list of figures generated (filenames + figure types)
- The ggplot2 / Python code used for each figure
- Bash output from `ls ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/` showing saved files
- Target journal

**The subagent performs these checks and returns a VISUALIZATION REPORT:**

```
VISUALIZATION VERIFICATION REPORT
===================================

FILE EXPORT

---

### B10 — Conceptual Diagrams (Non-Data Figures)

For theoretical frameworks, causal DAGs, process models, and flowcharts that don't require a data pipeline. These are generated as code and rendered to PDF/PNG.

**B10a — Mermaid Diagrams** (theoretical frameworks, process models, flowcharts):

```bash
# Write the Mermaid source
cat > "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-theoretical-framework.mmd" << 'EOF'
graph TD
    A[Neighborhood Disadvantage] --> B[Institutional Resources]
    A --> C[Social Cohesion]
    B --> D[Health Outcomes]
    C --> D
    A --> D
    E[Race/Ethnicity] --> A
    E --> D
EOF

# Render via mmdc (Mermaid CLI) — install: npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
npx mmdc -i "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-theoretical-framework.mmd" \
         -o "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-theoretical-framework.pdf" \
         -w 800 -H 600 --backgroundColor white
npx mmdc -i "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-theoretical-framework.mmd" \
         -o "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-theoretical-framework.png" \
         -w 800 -H 600 --backgroundColor white -s 3
```

**Common social science diagram templates:**

| Diagram | Mermaid type | Use case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Mediation model | `graph LR` with A→M→Y + A→Y | Causal mediation |
| Moderation model | `graph LR` with M moderating A→Y edge | Interaction effects |
| Coleman's boat | `graph TD` with macro→micro→micro→macro | Analytical sociology |
| Lifecycle model | `graph LR` with temporal stages | Life course analysis |
| Research design flowchart | `flowchart TD` with decision nodes | CONSORT / sample flow |
| Multi-level structure | `graph TD` with nested boxes | MLM / HLM |

**B10b — TikZ DAGs** (for causal diagrams requiring precise layout):

```bash
cat > "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/fig-dag.tex" << 'TIKZ'
\documentclass[tikz,border=5pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning,arrows.meta}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    node distance=2cm,
    var/.style={circle,draw,minimum size=1cm,font=\small},
    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=3mm]},thick}
]
\node[var] (X) {$X$};
\node[var,right=of X] (Y) {$Y$};
\node[var,above right=1cm and 1cm of X] (Z) {$Z$};
\draw[arr] (X) -- (Y);
\draw[arr] (Z) -- (X);
\draw[arr] (Z) -- (Y);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
TIKZ

# Render via xelatex
cd "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures" && xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode fig-dag.tex
# Convert to PNG for inspection
convert -density 300 fig-dag.pdf fig-dag.png 2>/dev/null || \
  sips -s format png fig-dag.pdf --out fig-dag.png 2>/dev/null || true
```

**B10c — SVG Diagrams** (for web / supplementary materials):

When Mermaid or TikZ are unavailable, generate SVG directly for simple diagrams. Claude Code can write SVG markup and save it, then convert to PDF via `rsvg-convert` or `inkscape --export-pdf`.

**Rules for B10:**
- Conceptual diagrams do NOT go through the inspect-and-revise loop (B0c) — they are layout-checked manually
- Always save both source file (.mmd / .tex / .svg) and rendered output (.pdf + .png)
- Use `Read` tool to inspect the rendered PNG and verify layout before proceeding

---

## REVISE-FIGURE Workflow (Mode 4)

Triggered when the user wants to modify an existing figure without re-running the full analysis pipeline. This mode reads an existing figure file, applies the requested changes, and saves the revised version using the version-check protocol.

### RF1 — Locate the figure

Parse the user's request to identify:
- **Target figure**: file path (e.g., `output/figures/fig-coef-plot.pdf`) or figure name
- **Requested changes**: one or more from the revision catalog below

If no file path is given, scan `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/` for matching files:
```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
ls -la "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/"*.pdf "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/figures/"*.png 2>/dev/null
```

### RF2 — Read the existing figure

Use the `Read` tool to inspect the existing PNG to understand current layout, then identify the R or Python script that produced it:
```bash
# Check if a generating script exists
grep -rl "[figure_name]" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/" 2>/dev/null
```

If the generating script exists, read it to understand the current code. If not, reconstruct from the figure type.

### RF3 — Apply revisions

| Revision type | What to change |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Rotate labels** | `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))` |
| **Resize** | Update `save_fig(p, name, w = NEW_W, h = NEW_H)` dimensions |
| **Relabel axes** | `labs(x = "New Label", y = "New Label")` |
| **Add reference line** | `geom_hline(yintercept = VALUE)` or `geom_vline(xintercept = VALUE)` |
| **Change colors** | Swap palette or use `scale_fill_manual(values = c(...))` |
| **Adjust faceting** | Change `facet_wrap(~var, ncol = N)` or switch to `facet_grid()` |
| **Add/remove legend** | `theme(legend.position = "bottom"/"none"/"right")` |
| **Reorder categories** | `mutate(var = fct_reorder(var, sort_var))` |
| **Add annotations** | `annotate("text", x = X, y = Y, label = "text")` |
| **Change to journal preset** | Apply `journal_dims$nhb_single` or `$asr` dimensions from B0 |
| **Add panel labels** | `library(patchwork); plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")` |
| **Switch to grayscale** | `scale_colour_grey()` + `scale_fill_grey()` |
| **Convert R to Python** | Load `viz-templates-python.md` and rewrite using equivalent template |
| **Convert Python to R** | Load `viz-templates-ggplot.md` and rewrite using equivalent template |

### RF4 — Execute and inspect

1. Run the modified code via Bash
2. Read the new PNG to verify the changes took effect
3. Apply the B0c Inspect-and-Revise protocol (auto-fix overlapping labels, truncated axes, etc.)
4. Save using version-check — the revised figure gets a new version suffix (never overwrites)

### RF5 — Update script archive

If a generating script exists in `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/`, save the revised version using the script version-check protocol. Append a decision entry to `coding-decisions-log.md` noting the revision and rationale.

---

## COMPONENT C: Results Section Writing

Using the actual numerical results from Components A and B, **write complete, publication-ready prose**. Replace every placeholder with real values. No brackets should remain in the final text.

### Journal-Specific Reporting Norms

| Journal | Effect estimate | Uncertainty | Significance | Target length |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| ASR | AME required for logit | SE in parentheses | Stars in tables + exact p in text | 1,500–2,500 words |
| AJS | AME preferred | SE in parentheses | Stars | 1,500–2,500 words |
| Demography | AME or OR + decomposition | Either | Stars | 2,000–3,000 words |
| Science Advances | AME preferred | 95% CI | Stars + `ns` marker | 1,500–2,000 words (main) |
| NHB | AME preferred | 95% CI + test stat + df | Stars + `ns` marker | 1,500–2,000 words (main) |

### Sentence Templates by Model Type

**OLS:**
> "A one-unit increase in [X] is associated with a [β]-unit change in [Y], holding other variables constant (b = [β], SE = [SE], p = [p])."

**AME from logit (ASR/AJS/Demography):**
> "A one-unit increase in [X] is associated with a [β×100] percentage point change in the probability of [Y] (AME = [β], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]])."

**AME from logit (NHB/Science Advances):**
> "A one-unit increase in [X] is associated with a [β×100] percentage point increase in the probability of [Y] (AME = [β], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]], z = [z], p = [p])."

**Fixed effects:**
> "Among [units] that changed [X] over time, a one-unit increase is associated with a [β]-unit change in [Y] (b = [β], SE = [SE], p = [p])."

**Interaction:**
> "The effect of [X] on [Y] is [β₁] for [Group A] and [β₂] for [Group B]; this difference is [significant/not distinguishable from zero] (b_interaction = [Δβ], SE = [SE], p = [p])."

**Null result:**
> "We find no statistically significant association between [X] and [Y] (b = [β], SE = [SE], p = [p])."

**Practical significance:**
> "While statistically significant, the effect (b = [β]) represents [X]% of the outcome's SD, a [small/moderate/large] magnitude."

**Robustness:**
> "Results are robust to [alternative sample restriction / alternative operationalization / alternative specification] (Table A1). Following Oster (2019), we estimate δ = [X], indicating that unobserved confounders would need to be [X] times more predictive of [Y] than our observed controls to explain away the finding."

**LCA / Mixture models:**
> "Latent class analysis identified [K] distinct [typologies/profiles] based on [indicators] (Table X). A [K]-class solution provided the best fit (BIC = [X]; entropy = [X]). Class 1 ([X]%) was characterized by [pattern]; Class 2 ([X]%) by [pattern]."

**Quantile regression:**
> "Quantile regression reveals that the association between [X] and [Y] varies across the outcome distribution (Table X; Figure X). At the 10th percentile, [X] is associated with [b] (SE = [SE], p = [p]), whereas at the 90th percentile the effect is [b] (SE = [SE], p = [p]). The OLS estimate of [b] masks this heterogeneity."

**Zero-inflated / Hurdle:**
> "Given the excess zeros in [Y] ([X]% of observations), we estimated a zero-inflated negative binomial model (Table X). In the count process, [X] was associated with a [X]% [increase/decrease] in expected [Y] (IRR = [X], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]], p = [p]). In the zero-inflation process, [Z] [increased/decreased] the probability of being a structural zero (OR = [X], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]], p = [p])."

**Specification curve analysis** — see A8o in `references/component-a-specialized.md` for the canonical template (Simonsohn, Simmons & Nelson 2020, *Nat Hum Behav*).

**Beta regression:**
> "Because [Y] is a bounded proportion, we estimated beta regression (Table X). [X] is associated with a [direction] in [Y] (b = [b], SE = [SE], p = [p]). The average marginal effect indicates a [AME] percentage-point change per one-unit increase in [X] (AME = [AME], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]])."

**Competing risks:**
> "The cumulative incidence of [event] at [T] years was [X]% (95% CI = [[lo]%, [hi]%]). In the Fine-Gray model, [X] was associated with a [X]% [higher/lower] subdistribution hazard of [event] (SHR = [X], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]], p = [p]), accounting for the competing risk of [competing event]."

**RI-CLPM:**
> "The RI-CLPM (Hamaker et al., 2015) separated stable between-person differences from within-person dynamics across [T] waves (Table X). At the within-person level, [X at time t] [predicted/did not predict] [Y at t+1] (b = [b], SE = [SE], p = [p]), while the reverse path was [significant/nonsignificant] (b = [b], SE = [SE], p = [p])."

**Sequence analysis:**
> "Sequence analysis with optimal matching identified [K] distinct [trajectory] typologies (Table X; Figure X). Cluster 1 ('[label],' [X]%) was characterized by [pattern]. [Covariate] was associated with [higher/lower] odds of following the '[label]' trajectory (RRR = [X], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]], p = [p])."

**SEM / CFA:**
> "Confirmatory factor analysis established the measurement model (Table X). All loadings exceeded [.40] (p < .001). The model fit well (CFI = [X], TLI = [X], RMSEA = [X] [90% CI: [lo], [hi]], SRMR = [X]). In the structural model, [latent predictor] was [positively/negatively] associated with [latent outcome] (b = [b], beta = [beta], p = [p])."

**Multiple testing correction:**
> "To account for [X] simultaneous tests, we applied [Benjamini-Hochberg / Holm] correction (Table X). After adjustment, [X] of [Y] hypotheses remained significant at FDR < .05."

---

### Results Section Structure

Write the following four paragraph types in order. Each must contain actual numbers.

```
¶1 SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
   Overall N; group sizes if stratified; means and SDs for key variables; reference Table 1.
   Note exclusions and reason.

¶2 MAIN FINDINGS (H1 test)
   State whether H1 is supported. Report focal coefficient with full statistics.
   Describe attenuation (or lack thereof) from M1 → M2. Reference Table 2.

¶3 EXTENDED MODEL (H2/moderation/mediation if applicable)
   M3 results; conditional effects at key moderator values; reference the marginal effects figure.
   Skip if no moderation/mediation hypothesis.

¶4 ROBUSTNESS
   2–4 sentences summarizing Table A1. Confirm main finding holds.
   Report Oster delta if OLS + causal language.
```

**Within-Group / Between-Group Interpretation Check (MANDATORY when comparing two or more groups):**

When the analysis compares groups (e.g., language corpora, treatment vs. control, racial groups), report BOTH perspectives before writing any interpretive claim:

```
INTERPRETATION CHECK — [Group comparison: e.g., Chinese vs English]

Between-group (cross-group AMEs / coefficient differences):
  - [Variable]: Group A has [X more/less] than Group B (AME = [value])

Within-group (absolute distributions for each group separately):
  - Group A: [key metric] = [value] (e.g., 18.4% positive, 20.1% negative → net -1.7pp)
  - Group B: [key metric] = [value] (e.g., 13.5% positive, 35.1% negative → net -21.6pp)

⚠ CONSISTENCY CHECK:
  - Do between-group and within-group comparisons support the SAME interpretation?
  - If not, flag: "WARNING: Cross-group framing suggests [X]; within-group shows [Y].
    Both perspectives must be reported in the Results prose."
```

Example of a flagged inconsistency:
> Cross-group: "CN has less negative Dem content than EN (AME = -6.8pp)" suggests CN is *less hostile*
> Within-group: "CN Dem sentiment is 29.2% neg vs 5.5% pos (5:1 ratio); CN Trump is 20.1% neg vs 18.4% pos (nearly balanced)" shows CN is *selectively critical of Democrats*
> → Both must be reported; the within-group framing is more consequential for interpretation

Append this check to the analysis log and include it in the Results prose output (File 2).

---

**Writing rules:**
- Lead every paragraph with the substantive finding, not a method description
- Report exact p-values in text (p = .034); use stars only in tables
- Reference tables and figures inline: "(Table 2, Column 3)"; "(Figure 2)"
- Report effect sizes alongside p-values — p < .001 without β is uninterpretable
- Hypothesis verdicts are NOT chosen by the writer. Apply the coded rule in `references/adjudication-rule.md`; every hypothesis statement uses the `prose_verb` column from `adjudication-log.csv` verbatim. "Directionally consistent" is reserved for `adjudication_code = AMBIGUOUS` and must NOT read as "supported". Never write "proves".
- Null findings must be reported with full statistics, not just "not significant"
- No passive voice constructions ("was found to be") — active voice only

---

## COMPONENT D: Script Archiving and Coding Decisions

This component runs **cross-cuttingly** throughout Components A and B. It ensures every executed code block is saved as a self-contained script, every analytic decision is logged with rationale, and a master script index maps scripts to paper elements — so that building a replication package later (via `/scholar-open`) requires assembly, not reconstruction.

### D0 — Initialize Script Log Files

Run at the start of every `scholar-analyze` session, immediately after `mkdir`:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"

# Initialize coding decisions log
cat > "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/coding-decisions-log.md" << 'LOGEOF'
# Coding Decisions Log
<!-- Append-only log. Each entry records one analytic decision with rationale. -->

| Timestamp | Step | Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale | Variables Affected | Script |
|-----------|------|----------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
LOGEOF

# Initialize script index
cat > "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/script-index.md" << 'IDXEOF'
# Script Index

## Run Order

| # | Script | Purpose | Input | Output | Paper Element |
|---|--------|---------|-------|--------|---------------|
IDXEOF
```

### D1 — Script Save Protocol (with Version Control)

Follow the version control protocol defined in `.claude/skills/_shared/script-version-check.md`. **NEVER overwrite an existing script.** Always version-check before saving.

Save timing differs by step class (pre-execution-review protocol, v5.29.1):
- **A3–A8 (model ladder): DRAFT-FIRST.** Scripts `04`–`09*` are WRITTEN at sub-stage A2.5 BEFORE execution, reviewed, and then executed from the reviewed files. The save IS the drafting step; post-review edits re-enter Step 6 re-review.
- **A1–A2b and B0–B8 (loading, descriptives, visualization): archive-after.** After each such code block is executed (or written as `[CODE-TEMPLATE]`), save the complete script.

Either way, save to `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/[NN]-[name].[ext]` — and **run the version check first**:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Run before EVERY script Write tool call
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SCRIPT_NAME="04-main-models"  # Replace with actual script name
EXT="R"                        # R, py, do, jl
SCRIPT_DIR="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts"
mkdir -p "$SCRIPT_DIR"

SCRIPT_BASE="${SCRIPT_DIR}/${SCRIPT_NAME}"
if [ -f "${SCRIPT_BASE}.${EXT}" ]; then
  V=2
  while [ -f "${SCRIPT_BASE}-v${V}.${EXT}" ]; do V=$((V + 1)); done
  SCRIPT_BASE="${SCRIPT_BASE}-v${V}"
fi
echo "SCRIPT_PATH=${SCRIPT_BASE}.${EXT}"
```

**Use the printed `SCRIPT_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Shell variables do NOT persist between Bash tool calls — re-derive in every new call.

**Standard script header** (prepend to every saved script):
```r
# ============================================================
# Script: [NN]-[name][-vN].R
# Version: [v1 | v2 | v3 ...]
# Purpose: [one-line description]
# Input:   [data file or prior script output]
# Output:  [tables, figures, or objects produced]
# Date:    [YYYY-MM-DD]
# Seed:    set.seed(42)
# Changes: [if v2+, one-line summary of what changed from prior version]
# Notes:   [SE type, sample restrictions, key parameters]
# ============================================================
```

**Scripts must be self-contained**: include explicit `library()` calls, data loading (`readRDS()`/`read_csv()`), and `set.seed()`. No reliance on in-memory objects from prior scripts.

### D2 — Coding Decisions Log Protocol

After EVERY analytic step in A0–A8, append an entry to `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/coding-decisions-log.md` via Bash `>>`. Each entry records one decision:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
echo "| $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') | A3 | OLS with HC3 robust SEs | Default SEs, clustered SEs | HC3 chosen because heteroskedasticity detected (BP p < .05) | Y, X, C1-C4 | 04-main-models.R |" >> "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/coding-decisions-log.md"
```

**Required decision categories** (log at least one entry for each when applicable):
- **Model type selection**: Why OLS vs. logit vs. FE vs. MLM
- **Standard error type**: Why HC3 vs. clustered vs. default
- **Control variable selection**: Which controls included and why; which excluded and why
- **Sample restrictions**: Any observations dropped; rationale
- **Missing data strategy**: Listwise deletion vs. MI; justification
- **Robustness design**: Which alternative specs and why they test the right threat

This incremental-persistence pattern protects against context compaction — decisions are on disk the moment they are made.

### D3 — Script Index Update

After each script is saved in D1, append a row to the run-order table in `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/script-index.md`:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
echo "| 4 | 04-main-models.R | Main regression ladder (M1-M3) | data/analysis_data.rds | ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/tables/table2-regression.html | Table 2 |" >> "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/scripts/script-index.md"
```

At the end of the run, finalize `script-index.md` by appending:

```markdown
## Dependencies
- Scripts 03–09 depend on 01-data-loading.R output
- Scripts 10–18 depend on model objects from 04 and 05

## Seeds
All scripts use `set.seed(42)`.

## Paper-Element Correspondence

## Internal Review Panel (MANDATORY before Save)

**Purpose:** Before the analysis log and publication-ready results are saved to disk, run a 5-agent review panel on the assembled analysis outputs. Each reviewer evaluates from a distinct analytic lens. A synthesizer aggregates consensus flags, a reviser produces improved outputs, and the user accepts the revision before Save Output.

**Relation to other skills:** This panel complements — does not replace — downstream `/scholar-code-review` (script auditing) and `/scholar-verify` (analysis-to-manuscript consistency). The panel catches issues early, at the analysis-finalization step; `/scholar-code-review` and `/scholar-verify` provide deeper, specialized audits later.

This step is REQUIRED. Skip only if the user explicitly passed `--skip-review` in `$ARGUMENTS`.

### Phase A — Assemble the Review Package

Compile the following in-memory (not yet saved):

1. **Analytic decisions**: estimator choice, SE type, variable coding, sample restrictions, missing-data strategy
2. **Raw model output paths**: `output/[slug]/tables/*.html`, `output/[slug]/models/*.rds`, `output/[slug]/figures/*.pdf`
3. **results-registry.csv** and **adjudication-log.csv** (contents + schema)
4. **Table/figure inventory**: every Table N and Figure N with filename and hypothesis mapping
5. **Scripts inventory**: `output/[slug]/scripts/*.R` with headers
6. **Results prose draft** (Component C output)
7. **A9 / B9 verification subagent outputs** (pass/fail summary)

### Phase B — Spawn Five Parallel Reviewer Subagents

Use the Task tool to run all 5 reviewers **in parallel** (five simultaneous tool calls). Fill in `[journal]`, `[design type]`, and `[REVIEW PACKAGE]` in each prompt.

---

**R1 — Estimator & Statistical Correctness Reviewer**

Spawn a `general-purpose` agent:

> "You are a statistician auditing an analysis for a paper targeting [journal] using a [design type] design. Critique the estimator and statistical choices. Evaluate each item as **Strong / Adequate / Weak** and give 3–5 specific, actionable comments:
>
> 1. **Estimator-outcome match**: Is the estimator appropriate for the outcome type (OLS for continuous; logit/probit for binary; ordered logit/multinomial for categorical; Poisson/NB for counts; Cox/AFT for survival)? Flag mismatches.
> 2. **Standard errors**: Does the SE type match the data structure (clustered SEs for multi-level / panel; HAC for time series; bootstrap for small N)? Is the clustering level correct and pre-specified?
> 3. **AME reporting**: For every logit/probit/ordered outcome, is AME reported (not just ORs/log-odds) and sourced from `marginaleffects::avg_slopes()` — not hand-computed?
> 4. **Variable coding**: Are categorical variables coded with sensible reference categories? Are continuous variables scaled/centered when interactions are involved? Are post-treatment controls excluded?
> 5. **Effect size + significance**: Are effect sizes reported alongside p-values? Are confidence intervals provided? Is multiple-testing correction applied if ≥ 5 hypotheses?
>
> End with your single most important fix.
>
> REVIEW PACKAGE: [paste package]"

---

**R2 — Table & Figure Quality Reviewer**

Spawn a `general-purpose` agent:

> "You are a journal production editor auditing tables and figures for a paper targeting [journal]. Critique artifact quality and publication-readiness. Evaluate each item as **Strong / Adequate / Weak** and give 3–5 specific, actionable comments:
>
> 1. **Table completeness**: Does every table have: column headers, N, R² / pseudo-R², SE type stated in notes, reference categories noted, significance stars defined, variable labels (not raw names)?
> 2. **Figure quality**: Are figures 300 DPI, colorblind-safe (no red-green), legend/axis labels in plain language, error bars with CI level stated, caption self-contained?
> 3. **Export formats**: Are tables exported in all required formats (HTML + TeX + docx + CSV for regression; CSV for `ame-[model].csv`, `coefficients-[model].csv`, `results-registry.csv`)?
> 4. **Journal norms**: Does artifact format match [journal]? (ASR/AJS: star notation, 2 decimals. Demography: standardized betas possible. Nature: self-contained figure captions, extended data figures allowed.)
> 5. **Table 1 descriptives**: Is Table 1 stratified by main exposure/treatment when appropriate? Are N, means/%, SDs reported? Is missingness disclosed?
>
> End with the single most impactful fix.
>
> REVIEW PACKAGE: [paste package]"

---

**R3 — Robustness Coverage Reviewer**

Spawn a `general-purpose` agent:

> "You are a methodologist reviewing the robustness plan for a paper targeting [journal] with a [design type] design. Critique whether robustness checks adequately address the validity threats. Evaluate each item as **Strong / Adequate / Weak** and give 3–5 specific, actionable comments:
>
> 1. **Threat-to-check mapping**: For each validity threat (confounding, selection, measurement error, model dependence, spillovers), is there a corresponding robustness check? Name any unaddressed threat.
> 2. **Omitted variable sensitivity**: Is Oster's delta or an E-value computed for the primary causal/associational claim?
> 3. **Alternative specifications**: Are at least 3 alternative model specifications run (different controls, subsample, functional form)? Are results qualitatively consistent?
> 4. **Sample restrictions**: Are sample definitions ablated (listwise vs MI; restricted vs full)? Does the main finding survive?
> 5. **Placebo / negative controls**: For causal designs, is a placebo test or negative control reported where feasible?
>
> End with the single most important missing robustness check.
>
> REVIEW PACKAGE: [paste package]"

---

**R4 — Results-Prose Alignment Reviewer**

Spawn a `general-purpose` agent:

> "You are a careful editor auditing alignment between results artifacts and the Results prose for a paper targeting [journal]. Critique one-to-one alignment between hypotheses, artifacts, and prose. Evaluate each item as **Strong / Adequate / Weak** and give 3–5 specific, actionable comments:
>
> 1. **Hypothesis coverage**: Is every hypothesis in `results-registry.csv` addressed in the Results prose? Flag any orphaned hypothesis.
> 2. **Adjudication fidelity**: Does the prose use the exact `prose_verb` from `adjudication-log.csv` for each hypothesis? Flag any synonym substitution (e.g., prose says 'supports' when log says 'partially supports').
> 3. **Numeric fidelity**: Pick 5 numeric claims at random from the prose. For each, does the value match the source table/CSV (check rounding, sign, units)?
> 4. **Causal language calibration**: If design is observational, is causal language ('causes', 'leads to', 'reduces') absent? If quasi-experimental, is it bounded by identifying assumptions?
> 5. **Null findings honesty**: Are null or negative findings reported transparently — not buried, omitted, or spun as 'marginal'?
>
> End with a list of specific lines/claims that need fixing.
>
> REVIEW PACKAGE: [paste package]"

---

**R5 — Reproducibility Reviewer**

Spawn a `general-purpose` agent:

> "You are a replication editor auditing reproducibility of an analysis targeting [journal]. Critique whether a third party could re-execute this analysis. Evaluate each item as **Strong / Adequate / Weak** and give 3–5 specific, actionable comments:
>
> 1. **Seeds**: Is `set.seed()` called in every script that uses randomness (bootstrap, MI, cross-validation, jitter)? Are seeds documented in the log?
> 2. **Environment**: Is `renv.lock` / `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml` present? Are package versions pinned? Is R/Python version documented?
> 3. **Script headers**: Does every script in `output/[slug]/scripts/` have purpose, input, output, date, seed, author?
> 4. **Paper-element correspondence**: Is there a table mapping every Table N / Figure N to the exact script that produces it? Are file paths relative (not absolute)?
> 5. **Data availability statement**: Is the data source documented (public URL, DOI, restricted-access DUA)? Is the access pathway clear for a replicator?
>
> End with the single most blocking reproducibility gap.
>
> REVIEW PACKAGE: [paste package]"

---

### Phase C — Synthesize Into Analysis Review Scorecard

After all 5 reviewers return, produce an **Analysis Review Scorecard**:

```
===== INTERNAL ANALYSIS REVIEW PANEL — [Topic] — [Journal] =====

Panel: R1 (Estimator) | R2 (Tables/Figures) | R3 (Robustness) | R4 (Prose Alignment) | R5 (Reproducibility)

| Dimension | R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | Consensus |

| Threat-to-check mapping | — | — | [S/A/W] | — | — | [S/A/W] |
| Oster delta / E-value | — | — | [S/A/W] | — | — | [S/A/W] |
| Alternative specs | — | — | [S/A/W] | — | — | [S/A/W] |
| Hypothesis coverage | — | — | — | [S/A/W] | — | [S/A/W] |

| Seeds + environment | — | — | — | — | [S/A/W] | [S/A/W] |
| Script headers + correspondence | — | — | — | — | [S/A/W] | [S/A/W] |
| **Weak items count** | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] | **[total]** |

★★ Cross-agent agreement (flagged by 2+ reviewers — highest priority):
1. [Issue] — flagged by [R#, R#] — [summary]
...

Top fix from each reviewer:
- R1: [fix]
- R2: [fix]
- R3: [fix]
- R4: [fix]
- R5: [fix]

OVERALL VERDICT: [Ready to save / Revise before save / Rerun analysis]
```

Log this phase:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-analyze"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
echo "| IRP-C | $(date +%H:%M:%S) | Review Scorecard | 5-agent panel synthesized | scorecard in-memory | ✓ |" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

### Phase D — Reviser Subagent (sequential, after Phase C)

Spawn a **reviser subagent**:

> "You are an expert social science analyst revising an analysis package for [journal]. You have feedback from a 5-agent review panel covering estimator correctness, table/figure quality, robustness coverage, results-prose alignment, and reproducibility. Produce a revised package that addresses all valid concerns.
>
> **Instructions**:
> 1. Address every ★★ item (cross-agent agreement) first
> 2. Address every item rated **Weak**; note any skipped items with reason
> 3. Do not change anything rated **Strong** by 2+ reviewers
> 4. If R1 flagged a wrong estimator or R5 flagged unreproducible code, produce a **Rerun Required** block at the top — do NOT proceed to Save Output; the user must rerun the affected scripts
> 5. Apply edits to: the Results prose draft, table/figure notes, adjudication-log adjustments, and script header fixes. Mark each substantive revision `[REV: reason]`
> 6. After the revised package, append a **Revision Notes** block listing ★★ items addressed, other changes, and reviewer comments not acted on with reason
>
> **Original REVIEW PACKAGE**: [paste]
> **Analysis Review Scorecard**: [paste]
> **R1 feedback**: [paste] | **R2**: [paste] | **R3**: [paste] | **R4**: [paste] | **R5**: [paste]"

### Phase E — Accept the Revision

1. Present Scorecard + Revision Notes + summary of revised package to the user
2. Ask: **"Accept revised analysis package? (`yes` / `accept with edits` / `keep original` / `rerun`)"**
   - `yes`: Use revised package for Save Output
   - `accept with edits`: Apply user's specific edits, then proceed
   - `keep original`: Append Scorecard + Revision Notes as an appendix to the saved log
   - `rerun`: Do NOT save; return to the failing component (A/B/C/D) for re-execution
3. Log the decision:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-analyze"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
echo "| IRP-E | $(date +%H:%M:%S) | Accept Revision | [user decision] | — | ✓ |" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

**HARD STOP**: Do NOT proceed to Save Output until the user accepts. If `rerun`, loop back to the flagged component.

### Pre-Save Review Checklist

Confirm all of the following before moving to Save Output:

- [ ] 5 reviewer subagents (estimator / tables-figures / robustness / prose-alignment / reproducibility) spawned in parallel via the Task tool
- [ ] Review Scorecard produced with per-dimension consensus ratings + ★★ cross-agent flags
- [ ] Reviser subagent produced an improved analysis package addressing all ★★ and Weak items (or noted reasons for skipping)
- [ ] User decision recorded (yes / accept with edits / keep original / rerun) and logged at Phase E

---

## Save Output

Use the Write tool to save **two separate files** after completing all components.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [values] with actuals before running
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# BASE pattern: ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/analysis/scholar-analyze-log-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
# Split into directory and stem for the gate script:
OUTDIR="$(dirname "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/analysis/scholar-analyze-log-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/analysis/scholar-analyze-log-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file. The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).

For File 2, change the BASE to:
`${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/analysis/scholar-analyze-results-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]`

---

[State H1 support.] [Focal predictor] is [positively/negatively] associated with [outcome]
after adjusting for [list key controls] (b = [β], SE = [SE], p = [p]; Table 2, Column 2).
[For logit:] The average marginal effect indicates a [β×100] percentage point [increase/decrease]
in the probability of [outcome] per one-unit increase in [X] (AME = [β], 95% CI = [[lo], [hi]]).
[Describe coefficient stability M1 → M2.] [Reference figure if applicable: Figure 1.]

[¶3 — EXTENDED MODEL / INTERACTION / MEDIATION — omit if not applicable]
[M3 results. Conditional effects at key moderator values. Reference Figure X.]

[¶4 — ROBUSTNESS]
Results are robust to [alternative sample restriction / alternative operationalization /
alternative specification] (Table A1, Columns 2–3). [Report Oster delta if applicable:
Following Oster (2019), we estimate δ = [X], indicating that unobserved confounders
would need to be [X] times more predictive of [Y] than our observed controls to
explain away the finding.]

**Output files produced by this skill:**
- `output/[slug]/tables/` — regression tables and descriptive stats (.html / .tex / .docx)
- `output/[slug]/figures/` — all figures (.pdf / .png; interactive as .html)
- `output/[slug]/scripts/` — self-contained analysis scripts (`[NN]-[name].R/.py`), `coding-decisions-log.md`, `script-index.md`
- `scholar-analyze-log-[topic]-[date].md` — internal technical log (decisions, verification, file inventory)
- `scholar-analyze-results-[topic]-[date].md` — **publication-ready**: Results section prose + table notes + figure captions; ready to paste into `/scholar-write`

**Post-analysis verification:**

The fast 3 review agents (`statistics`, `data-handling`, `correctness`) already adjudicated the model ladder at sub-stage A2.5 — that part is a gate, not a suggestion. After all tables and figures are produced, suggest to the user:

> "Analysis outputs saved (model scripts passed pre-execution review at A2.5). Consider also running:
> - `/scholar-code-review full` to add the 3 deferred review dimensions (`reproducibility`, `robustness`, `style`) across all scripts.
> - `/scholar-verify stage1` to verify raw outputs (tables, figures) are internally consistent before writing.
> These catch the remaining error classes before they propagate into the manuscript."

The deferred-3 follow-up is a recommendation, not a gate — the user may proceed directly to `/scholar-write` if preferred. If run, `scholar-code-review` launches 6 review agents on scripts in `output/scripts/`; `scholar-verify stage1` launches verify-numerics and verify-figures on the raw outputs in `output/tables/` and `output/figures/`.

### Knowledge Graph Write-Back (post-save)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/.claude/skills"
KG_REF="$SKILL_DIR/_shared/knowledge-graph-search.md"
if [ -f "$KG_REF" ]; then
  eval "$(cat "$KG_REF" | sed -n '/^```bash/,/^```/p' | sed '1d;$d')" 2>/dev/null
  if kg_available 2>/dev/null; then
    echo ""
    echo "═══ Knowledge Graph ═══"
    echo "File your new findings back into the knowledge graph:"
    echo "  /scholar-knowledge ingest from output [results-file-path]"
    echo "This lets future /scholar-write and /scholar-lit-review runs reference your own empirical results."
  fi
fi
```

**Close Process Log:**

Run the following to finalize the process log:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-analyze"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
cat >> "$LOG_FILE" << LOGFOOTER
