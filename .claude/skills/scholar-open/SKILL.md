description: >
  Implement open science practices for a social science study. Five modes:
  (1) PREREGISTER — OSF / AsPredicted / EGAP / Registered Reports; secondary-data preregistration; deviation reporting;
  (2) DATA-SHARE — FAIR principles, de-identification, repository selection (Dataverse / ICPSR / Zenodo / QDR), social media policies, computational data (model weights, embeddings), data availability statements;
  (3) CODE-SHARE — minimum + gold-standard replication packages, README template, renv / conda / Docker / Makefile environments, CITATION.cff, Zenodo DOI via GitHub;
  (4) FULL-PACKAGE — data management plan (NSF/NIH template), CRediT authorship, COI, IRB statement, preprint strategy, open access + APC waiver guidance;
  (5) REPLICATION-PACKAGE — end-to-end audit against journal requirements.
  Required at Nature journals; increasingly expected at ASR, Demography, and Science Advances. Saves preregistration document, data management plan, and replication-package README to disk.

## Step 1: PREREGISTRATION

### 1a. When to Preregister

**Strongly recommended (increasingly required)**:
- Original data collection (survey, experiment, field study)
- Nature Human Behaviour, Nature Computational Science: expected; non-preregistration must be stated in Methods
- Science Advances: encouraged; flag as "preregistered" in cover letter
- ASR/AJS: growing reviewer expectation; protects against p-hacking allegations

**Still valuable (optional)**:
- Secondary data analysis with pre-specified hypotheses (see Section 1f)
- Replication studies — use AsPredicted "registered replication" format
- Registered Reports (see Section 1c) — submit before data collection; two-stage review

**Not applicable (say so explicitly)**:
- Purely inductive qualitative work — note "inductive design; preregistration not applicable"
- Archival/historical analysis where hypotheses emerge from sources
- Exploratory computational work generating theory (label all analyses "exploratory")

### 1b. Preregistration Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Embargo | DOI | URL |
|----------|----------|---------|-----|-----|
| **OSF Preregistrations** | Social science; most flexible templates | Yes (4 years) | Yes | osf.io/registries |
| **AsPredicted** | Quick 9-question; confirmatory studies | Yes (until publication) | No | aspredicted.org |
| **EGAP** | Political science / field experiments | Yes | Yes | egap.org/registry |
| **AEA RCT Registry** | Economics / social science RCTs | Yes | Yes | socialscienceregistry.org |
| **OSF Registered Reports** | Pre-results peer review (any design) | No | Yes | osf.io/registries |

### 1c. Registered Reports (RR) Format

Registered Reports are a special journal format where peer review occurs in two stages:
- **Stage 1**: Methods + Introduction reviewed and conditionally accepted before data collection
- **Stage 2**: Full results submitted; accepted regardless of findings (in-principle acceptance)

**Journals accepting RRs in social/computational sciences**:
- *Nature Human Behaviour*, *Psychological Science*, *PLOS ONE*, *Collabra*, *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science (AMPPS)*, *Social Psychology* — growing list at cos.io/rr

**RR Manuscript Structure**:
```
Stage 1 Submission:
├── Introduction (full theory + hypotheses)
├── Methods (complete design, sampling, measures, analysis plan)
├── Power analysis (justify N)
└── No Results or Discussion

Stage 2 Submission (after data collection):
├── Introduction (unchanged)
├── Methods (unchanged; note any deviations)
├── Results
└── Discussion
```

**OSF RR Preregistration workflow**:
1. Write Stage 1 manuscript
2. Submit to journal; receive In-Principle Acceptance (IPA)
3. Register on OSF with IPA letter attached
4. Collect data; write Stage 2 manuscript
5. Submit Stage 2 to same journal; link OSF registration

### Registered Reports — Stage 1 Submission Template

**Required sections for Stage 1 (In-Principle Acceptance)**:

1. **Introduction & Rationale** (800--1500 words)
   - Research question and significance
   - Theoretical framework
   - Hypotheses (numbered, directional)

2. **Methods** (1500--3000 words)
   - Study design (with diagram if complex)
   - Participants: target N, sampling strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Materials/measures: all instruments, scales, variable operationalization
   - Procedure: step-by-step protocol

3. **Analysis Plan** (1000--2000 words)
   - Primary analyses: exact model specifications for each hypothesis
   - Secondary/exploratory analyses (clearly labeled)
   - **Stopping rules**: minimum N for adequacy; interim analysis plan (if applicable)
   - **Exclusion criteria**: pre-specified rules for excluding observations/participants
   - **Multiple comparisons**: correction method + which outcomes are primary vs. exploratory
   - **Power analysis**: target power (>=0.80), assumed effect size (with justification from prior work), sample size calculation (with code)
   - **Robustness checks**: pre-specified alternative specifications
   - **Positive result criteria**: what constitutes support for each hypothesis?
   - **Interpretation of null results**: planned equivalence test bounds (if applicable)

4. **Timeline & Feasibility**
   - Data collection start/end dates
   - IRB status
   - Funding status
   - Data access confirmed (for secondary data)

5. **Stage 2 Deviation Documentation** (template for later)
   - Any deviations from Stage 1 protocol must be documented with justification
   - Classify deviations: minor (does not affect interpretation) vs. major (affects primary analyses)

**Journals accepting Registered Reports**: Nature Human Behaviour, Cortex, Royal Society Open Science, European Journal of Social Psychology, Political Science Research and Methods, others (see COS registry: cos.io/rr/).

### 1d. OSF Preregistration Workflow

**Step 1**: Create OSF account → New Project → Add collaborators → Organize folders
```
OSF Project structure:
├── Preregistration/   ← Lock registration here
├── Data/              ← Deposit analysis dataset
├── Code/              ← Link to GitHub repository
└── Papers/            ← Preprint + published version
```

**Step 2**: Write the preregistration document (use template below — save as PDF and upload)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  1. [RQ1 — specific, answerable]
  2. [RQ2 — if applicable]

Hypotheses (numbered, directional):
  H1: [Variable X] is positively/negatively associated with [Outcome Y]
      among [Population Z].
      Rationale: [2–3 sentences from theory section]

─────────────
Existing data: Yes / No
If yes: [Describe what you know; confirm no confirmatory analyses run yet]
Data collection: [Detailed procedure]
Sample size: N = [X]; justify via power analysis
  Power analysis: We need N = [X] to detect d = [Y] / β = [Z] with 80%
  power at α = .05 (two-tailed), using [pwr::pwr.t.test / simr / MDES].
Stopping rule: [Pre-specified; e.g., "close survey after N = 1,000 completes
  or 90 days, whichever comes first"]

  [robust SEs / clustered SEs at level Z / bootstrapped SEs]
  Equation: Y_i = β₀ + β₁X_i + β₂C₁ + β₃C₂ + ε_i
  Test for H1: β₁ significantly positive (p < .05, two-tailed)
  Test for H2: β₃ (X × Group) significantly different from zero

Sample restrictions:
  Include: [Age range; employment status; geography]
  Exclude: [Missing on outcome (N ≈ ?); extreme outliers > 3 SD]

Transformations: [Log income; standardize continuous predictors (mean=0, SD=1)]
Missing data: [Listwise deletion / Multiple imputation (m=20, mice package)]
Multiple comparisons: [We test [N] hypotheses; apply [Bonferroni / BH-FDR /
  none — hypotheses derived from single theory and are not independent]]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Step 3**: Lock the preregistration
- Upload PDF to OSF project
- Click "Register" → choose "OSF Preregistration" template
- Optionally set embargo (up to 4 years)
- Once locked, **cannot be modified** — deviations must be reported in paper

**Step 4**: Cite in manuscript
> "This study was preregistered prior to data collection at the Open Science
> Framework (https://osf.io/[ID], registered [date])."

### 1e. AsPredicted Quick Format (9 Questions)

Use when you want a quick preregistration before accessing data:

```
1. Data collection. Have any data been collected already?
   → [No / Yes, but I have not conducted any confirmatory analysis]

2. Hypothesis. What's the main question / hypothesis?
   H1: [Directional prediction]

3. Dependent variable. How measured?
   [Name; scale; reference period; e.g., "Income in USD, continuous, past year"]

4. Conditions. How many conditions?
   [Observational: N/A / Experimental: [list treatment arms]]

5. Analyses. Exact model?
   [OLS / logistic / FE with robust SEs; controls: age, gender, race, education]

6. Outliers and exclusions. Criteria?
   [Exclude missing on DV; winsorize income at 99th percentile]

7. Sample size. How many obs / what determines it?
   [N = 1,200; secondary data PSID 2019 wave]

8. Other. Anything else to preregister?
   [Exploratory: heterogeneity by race; will be labeled exploratory in paper]

9. Title. Give a title.
   [Preregistration of: Paper Title]
```

### 1f. Secondary Data Preregistration

Even with existing data, preregistering before confirmatory analysis retains value:

**Three scenarios and how to handle**:

| Scenario | Preregistration approach |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Downloaded but not looked at | Full preregistration; note data downloaded but analyses not run |
| Looked at descriptives only | Partial preregistration; note "examined descriptive statistics; no confirmatory analyses run" |
| Fully analyzed exploratory | Cannot preregister confirmatory analysis; label all results "exploratory" |

**Language for secondary data preregistration**:
```
Methods section:
"Although this study uses secondary data ([Dataset, year]), we preregistered
our hypotheses and analysis plan before conducting any confirmatory analyses
(OSF: https://osf.io/[code], registered [date]). Prior to registration, we
had examined [descriptive statistics / variable distributions] but had not
tested any directional hypotheses."
```

**Language for un-preregistered secondary data**:
```
"This study uses secondary data and was not preregistered. All reported
analyses should be interpreted as exploratory. To guard against inflated
Type I error, we [applied Bonferroni correction / report exact p-values
and encourage replication / conducted a pre-specified sensitivity analysis
with a held-out validation sample (N = [X])]."
```

### 1g. Reporting Deviations

Every deviation from the preregistration MUST be disclosed:

```
"Our preregistered analysis plan specified [X]. We deviate from this plan
in the following ways:
  (1) [Deviation]: [We added a covariate (household size) not in the original
      plan because reviewers of a related paper flagged it as a potential
      confounder.] The preregistered specification (without this control) is
      reported in Appendix Table A[X] and yields [consistent / slightly
      different] results.
  (2) [Deviation]: [We changed the SE clustering level from individual to
      county after discovering within-county clustering in the residuals.]"
```

See `references/preregistration.md` for templates and platform comparisons.

## Step 2: DATA SHARING

### 2a. FAIR Data Principles

FAIR = **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eusable.
Required for Nature journals; NHB/NCS reporting summary asks about each dimension.

| Principle | What it means | How to implement |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Findable** | Data has persistent identifier (DOI) and rich metadata | Deposit in Zenodo/Dataverse with DOI; fill title, authors, subject, description |
| **Accessible** | Data retrievable via standard protocol; access conditions clear | Use HTTPS-accessible repository; specify who can access restricted data + how |
| **Interoperable** | Uses standard formats and vocabulary | Save as CSV/TSV (not Excel); use standard codebook with variable names + labels; apply domain ontologies where relevant |
| **Reusable** | Clear license; rich provenance; data described fully | Attach LICENSE (CC-BY or CC0); write codebook documenting all variables, value codes, missing codes, transformations |

**FAIR compliance checklist for manuscript**:
- [ ] Dataset deposited with DOI
- [ ] Metadata: title, authors, abstract, keywords, date, version filled
- [ ] Data in open format (CSV, TSV, JSON — not SPSS .sav or Stata .dta without conversion)
- [ ] Codebook documents all variables (name, label, type, range, missing code)
- [ ] LICENSE file present (CC0 for data; CC-BY or MIT for code)
- [ ] Provenance documented (where data came from, transformations applied)

### FAIR Principles — Operationalization Checklist

**Findable**:
- [ ] Dataset has a globally unique persistent identifier (DOI via Zenodo/Dataverse/ICPSR)
- [ ] Rich metadata (title, authors, description, keywords, temporal coverage, geographic scope)
- [ ] Metadata searchable in repository catalog
- [ ] README.md included with dataset

**Accessible**:
- [ ] Data retrievable via standard protocol (HTTPS download or API)
- [ ] Access conditions clearly stated (open / restricted / embargoed)
- [ ] If restricted: DUA template provided; contact information for access requests
- [ ] Metadata accessible even if data is restricted

**Interoperable**:
- [ ] Data in open format (CSV, TSV, Parquet — NOT proprietary Excel/SPSS/SAS)
- [ ] Variables use standard vocabularies where possible
- [ ] Codebook/data dictionary included with variable labels, value labels, missing data codes
- [ ] Character encoding: UTF-8

**Reusable**:
- [ ] Clear license specified (CC-BY 4.0 recommended; CC0 for maximum reuse)
- [ ] Provenance documented (data source, collection method, processing steps)
- [ ] Data cleaning scripts included (or referenced)
- [ ] Citation instructions provided (BibTeX entry for the dataset)

### 2b. Data Sensitivity Classification

```
Can you share the data?
│
├─ ORIGINAL COLLECTION
│   ├─ Fully de-identified + consent allows sharing
│   │   └─ → Deposit openly (Harvard Dataverse / Zenodo / OSF)
│   ├─ Sensitive (health, income, location) → de-identify first (Step 2d)
│   │   └─ → Deposit with access controls (ICPSR restricted / embargoed Dataverse)
│   └─ Cannot share (IRB restriction, no consent)
│       └─ → Code only; restricted-access data availability statement
│
├─ SECONDARY DATA
│   ├─ Public-use (ACS, GSS, CPS, HRS public, NLSY public)
│   │   └─ → Include processed data in package OR point to official download
│   ├─ Restricted-use (NLSY Geo, FSRDC, linkage files)
│   │   └─ → Code only; describe access pathway in paper
│   └─ Licensed/proprietary (Gallup, Nielsen, LexisNexis)
│       └─ → Code + derived aggregates if permitted; data access statement
│
├─ SOCIAL MEDIA (see Step 2f for platform-specific rules)
│   ├─ Twitter/X: Cannot redistribute raw; can share tweet IDs (rehydrate)
│   ├─ Reddit: pushshift data sharing restricted since 2023; share post IDs
│   └─ Derived data (DTM, embeddings, aggregated counts): usually shareable
│
└─ COMPUTATIONAL / ML (see Step 2e)
    ├─ Model weights: share via HuggingFace Hub or Zenodo
    └─ Embeddings / feature matrices: share as CSV/numpy array via Zenodo
```

### 2c. Repository Selection

| Repository | Field | Max size | Access control | Best for |
|------------|-------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Harvard Dataverse** | Social science | 2.5 GB/file, 1 TB/dataset | Public / restricted / embargo | Survey data, population datasets, sociology |
| **ICPSR** | Social/behavioral | Unlimited | Restricted-use support | Large surveys, administrative data, longitudinal |
| **OSF** | Broad | 50 GB total | Public / private | Small datasets; integrates with preregistration |
| **Zenodo** | Broad/computational | 50 GB/record | Public (versioned) | Code + data; NCS requirement; GitHub integration |
| **QDR** | Qualitative SS | Moderate | Project-based | Interview transcripts, field notes, mixed methods |
| **UK Data Service** | UK social science | Large | Restricted | UK-based population data |

**Harvard Dataverse deposit steps**:
```
1. dataverse.harvard.edu → Log in → "Add Data" → "New Dataset"
2. Fill metadata: title, author, contact, description, subject, keywords
3. Upload files (data + codebook.pdf + README.md + code/)
4. Set access:
   - Public: available immediately on publication
   - Restricted: requestors must apply + sign DUA
   - Embargo: public after [date] (use for pre-publication)
5. Publish → receives DOI (e.g., https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/...)
```

**Zenodo + GitHub auto-archive**:
```bash
# 1. Go to zenodo.org/account/settings/github
# 2. Toggle ON the repository
# 3. Create a GitHub release:
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# → Zenodo auto-creates DOI for this release
# Add badge to README:
# [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX.svg)]
```

### 2d. De-Identification Procedures

**Direct identifiers — remove entirely**:
- [ ] Full name → participant ID (store ID-name lookup table separately, encrypted)
- [ ] Exact address → state / county / 3-digit ZIP
- [ ] Date of birth → age in years (or 5-year age bands if N < 100 per cell)
- [ ] Exact event dates → year or year-quarter
- [ ] Phone numbers, email addresses, SSNs → remove
- [ ] Employer name → NAICS/SIC industry code
- [ ] School name → institution type/level
- [ ] Photos, voice recordings → store separately; do not deposit publicly

**Quasi-identifiers — suppress or aggregate**:
Apply k-anonymity: every combination of quasi-identifiers (sex × race × age × geography)
must appear at least k=5 times.

```r
library(sdcMicro)
sdc <- createSdcObj(dat = df,
                    keyVars = c("age_cat", "sex", "race", "state"),
                    numVars = c("income", "earnings"))
print(sdc)                       # Risk statistics
sdc <- localSuppression(sdc, k = 5)
clean_df <- extractManipData(sdc)

# Additional: top-code extremes
clean_df$income <- pmin(clean_df$income, quantile(clean_df$income, .99))
```

**Additional techniques**:
- **Cell suppression**: Replace cells with N < 5 with `NA` in public tables
- **Top/bottom-coding**: Income > $500K → "500K+" (report threshold in codebook)
- **Noise injection**: Add small random noise to continuous variables (document in codebook)

### 2e. Computational Data Sharing (Model Weights, Embeddings)

For computational papers (NCS, Science Advances, CSS venues):

| Artifact | Format | Repository | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Fine-tuned model weights | HuggingFace Hub (safetensors) | HuggingFace + Zenodo for DOI | License: Apache-2.0 if based on Apache model |
| Pre-trained embeddings (dense vectors) | numpy `.npy` / CSV | Zenodo | Include column/row metadata |
| Document-term matrix | scipy sparse `.npz` / CSV | Zenodo | Include vocabulary file |
| Topic model (STM/LDA) | `.rds` (R) / `.pkl` (Python) | OSF or Zenodo | Include run script |
| Annotation labels (LLM/human) | CSV with doc_id, label, annotator | Zenodo | Include codebook + IAA scores |
| Network edgelist | CSV (source, target, weight) | Zenodo or Harvard Dataverse | Include node attribute file |

**HuggingFace Hub upload**:
```python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi
api = HfApi()
api.create_repo(repo_id="username/paper-model", repo_type="model")
api.upload_folder(
    folder_path="./model_weights",
    repo_id="username/paper-model",
    repo_type="model"
)
# Add model card README with paper citation, training details, intended use
```

**Linking to Zenodo for persistent DOI**:
```python
# After uploading to Zenodo manually or via API:
# In paper: "Model weights and embeddings are archived at [DOI]"
# In HuggingFace model card: "Archived version: [Zenodo DOI]"
```

### 2f. Social Media Platform Policies

| Platform | Raw data | Tweet/Post IDs | Derived features | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Twitter/X** | Cannot redistribute | Can share (rehydrate via API) | DTM, embeddings: OK | Use `twarc` to rehydrate IDs |
| **Reddit** | Cannot redistribute | Can share post/comment IDs | Aggregated metrics: OK | Pushshift no longer public post-2023; use Reddit API |
| **Facebook/Meta** | Cannot redistribute | Cannot share | Aggregated only | CrowdTangle shut down 2024; use Meta Content Library (academic) |
| **TikTok** | Cannot redistribute | Cannot share | Aggregated only | TikTok Research API (apply) |
| **YouTube** | Cannot redistribute | Video IDs: OK | Aggregated metrics: OK | YouTube Data API v3 |
| **Mastodon** | Federated — check instance ToS | Can share post URLs | Derived: OK | More permissive than corporate platforms |
| **LinkedIn** | Cannot redistribute | Cannot share | Aggregated only | Very restricted; academic access via approved partners |

**Tweet ID archive deposit**:
```python
# Save tweet IDs only (compliant with Twitter ToS)
import pandas as pd
df_ids = df[['tweet_id', 'created_at']].copy()  # IDs + timestamps only
df_ids.to_csv('tweet_ids.csv', index=False)
# Deposit tweet_ids.csv on Zenodo

# Rehydration instruction in README:
# twarc2 hydrate tweet_ids.csv --output hydrated_tweets.jsonl
```

**Data availability statement for social media**:
```
"The raw social media data cannot be redistributed per the platform's Terms of
Service. Tweet/post IDs sufficient for data reconstruction are available at
[Zenodo DOI]. The derived dataset (document-term matrix / aggregated engagement
counts) used in this analysis is also archived at [Zenodo DOI]. Data collection
and processing code is available at [GitHub URL]."
```

### 2g. Data Availability Statement Templates

**Fully open (deposited)**:
```
"The data that support the findings of this study are openly available at
[Harvard Dataverse / Zenodo] at https://doi.org/[DOI], reference number [X]."
```

**Restricted (apply for access)**:
```
"The data used in this study are available through [ICPSR / institutional
repository] under a restricted data use agreement. Instructions for obtaining
access are available at [URL]. The analysis code is available at [GitHub URL]."
```

**Secondary public data (no deposit)**:
```
"The [General Social Survey / American Community Survey / NLSY] data used in
this study are publicly available and can be downloaded from [official source URL].
The derived analytic dataset and replication code are archived at [Zenodo/Dataverse
DOI]."
```

**Qualitative (anonymized excerpts only)**:
```
"Interview transcripts cannot be publicly shared to protect participant
confidentiality per IRB protocol [number]. Anonymized excerpts supporting the
main findings are provided in the Online Supplementary Appendix. Requests for
additional access should be directed to the corresponding author."
```

**Social media (IDs + derived)**:
```
[See Section 2f template above]
```

See `references/data-sharing.md` for repository setup, de-identification code, and FAIR
implementation.

### Data Sharing Statements for Restricted Data

**When data cannot be shared publicly**:

Template 1 (Licensed data — PSID, NLSY, NHANES restricted):
```
"The data used in this study are available from [source] under a restricted-use Data Use Agreement. Researchers can apply for access at [URL]. Our analysis code is available at [repository URL] and can be applied to the data once access is granted."
```

Template 2 (IRB-restricted qualitative data):
```
"Interview transcripts contain identifying information and cannot be shared per our IRB protocol ([institution], #[number]). De-identified thematic summaries and the codebook are available at [repository URL]. Interested researchers may contact [email] to discuss data access."
```

Template 3 (Partner/proprietary data):
```
"The data were provided by [organization] under a data sharing agreement that prohibits redistribution. Interested researchers should contact [organization contact] to negotiate access. Our analysis code is available at [repository URL]."
```

---

## Step 3: CODE & REPLICATION PACKAGES

### 3-pre. Consume `output/[slug]/scripts/` (from scholar-analyze / scholar-compute)

If `output/[slug]/scripts/` exists from a prior `/scholar-analyze` or `/scholar-compute` run, use it as the primary source for replication package code:

1. **Copy and renumber** scripts from `output/[slug]/scripts/` into the replication package `code/` directory. Preserve the original numbering where possible; renumber only if gaps or collisions exist.
2. **Copy `coding-decisions-log.md`** into the package root as `DECISIONS.md` — this provides reviewers and replicators with the rationale behind every analytic choice.
3. **Use `script-index.md`** to populate the README run-order table and paper-element correspondence table (Step 3b).

This eliminates the need to reconstruct scripts from memory or scratch — all code is already saved, self-contained, and documented with decision rationale.

If `output/[slug]/scripts/` does not exist, proceed with the standard Step 3a approach below.

# Replication Package for: [Paper Title]

## Citation
[Author(s)]. ([Year]). [Paper Title]. *[Journal]*, *[Vol]*([Issue]), [Pages].
https://doi.org/[DOI]

Replication package archived at: https://doi.org/[Zenodo DOI]

## Overview
[2–3 sentences describing what this package reproduces: which tables, figures,
and analyses from the paper.]

## Software Requirements

### R
- R version 4.3.2 (or later)
- Restore package environment: `Rscript -e "renv::restore()"`
- Key packages: fixest (>= 0.12.1)), modelsummary (1.4.5), marginaleffects (0.18.0)

### Python (if applicable)
- Python 3.11
- Install: `conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate [env-name]`
- OR: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### System dependencies
- [pdftotext, if used] — install via `brew install poppler` (macOS)

## Data Sources

| File | Source | Access | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| `data/raw/gss_2022.csv` | GSS (NORC) | Download from gss.norc.org | Wave 2022 |
| `data/raw/acs_sample.rds` | ACS via tidycensus | Included (public) | 5-year 2019–2023 |
| `data/processed/analysis_data.rds` | Derived | Included | Output of 01_clean.R |

## Run Order

```bash
# Option A: Run full pipeline via Makefile
make all

# Option B: Run scripts manually in order
Rscript code/01_clean.R
Rscript code/02_main_models.R    # → output/tables/table2.tex, table3.tex
Rscript code/03_figures.R        # → output/figures/figure1.pdf – figure3.pdf
Rscript code/04_appendix.R       # → output/tables/tableA1.tex – tableA4.tex
```

## Output Files

| Script | Output | Corresponds to |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| 02_main_models.R | table2.tex, table3.tex | Tables 2–3 in paper |
| 03_figures.R | figure1.pdf, figure2.pdf | Figures 1–2 in paper |
| 04_appendix.R | tableA1.tex – tableA4.tex | Appendix Tables A1–A4 |

## Expected Runtime
Full replication: ~[X] minutes on a standard laptop ([RAM] RAM, [CPU]).
ML training step (02_model_train.py): ~[X] hours on GPU; pre-trained weights
provided in `output/models/` to skip this step.

## Random Seeds
All random seeds are set at the top of each script: `set.seed(42)` (R);
`np.random.seed(42); torch.manual_seed(42)` (Python).

### 3c. Reproducibility Environments

#### R — renv

```r
# Initialize renv in project directory
renv::init()

# After installing all packages, snapshot:
renv::snapshot()
# → Creates renv.lock with exact package versions

# To restore on another machine:
renv::restore()
```

#### Python — Conda environment

```bash
# Create from scratch:
conda create -n paper-env python=3.11
conda activate paper-env
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Export to environment.yml:
conda env export > environment.yml
# Prune to essentials (remove build strings for portability):
conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

# To recreate on another machine:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate paper-env
```

#### Python — requirements.txt (pip only)

```bash
# Pin exact versions:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Makefile (pipeline orchestrator)

```makefile
# Makefile for replication pipeline

.PHONY: all data models analysis figures clean

all: figures

data: data/processed/analysis_data.rds

data/processed/analysis_data.rds: code/01_clean.R data/raw/
	Rscript code/01_clean.R

models: data/processed/analysis_data.rds
	Rscript code/02_main_models.R

figures: models
	Rscript code/03_figures.R
	Rscript code/04_appendix.R

clean:
	rm -rf output/tables/* output/figures/*
```

#### Docker (NCS gold standard)

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:4.4.1

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy project
COPY . /paper

# Restore R environment
WORKDIR /paper
RUN Rscript -e "renv::restore()"

# Default command
CMD ["make", "all"]
```

```bash
# Build and run:
docker build -t paper-replication .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/paper/output paper-replication
```

### 3d. Code Quality Standards

**Script header template** (use at top of every script):
```r
# ============================================================
# Script: 02_main_models.R
# Purpose: Estimate main OLS + FE models (Tables 2–3)
# Input:   data/processed/analysis_data.rds
# Output:  output/tables/table2.tex, output/tables/table3.tex
# Author:  [Name]
# Date:    [YYYY-MM-DD]
# Notes:   Clustered SEs at state level; AME via marginaleffects
# ============================================================

library(fixest)
library(modelsummary)
library(marginaleffects)

set.seed(42)  # For reproducibility

data <- readRDS("data/processed/analysis_data.rds")
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/myname/Desktop/...`) — use project-relative paths
- No script-level comments
- Single 2,000-line omnibus script
- No run order documentation
- Results that require manually sourcing intermediate objects
- `rm(list=ls())` at top of script (destroys reproducibility)

### 4e. Open Access Strategy

| Scenario | Recommended action |
|----------|--------------------|
| NSF- or NIH-funded | Deposit preprint on SocArXiv/SSRN before submission; journal version goes through publisher OA after acceptance |
| Science Advances target | APC required (~$4,950); verify NSF/NIH public access compliance; APC waivers available for AAAS members + low-income affiliations |
| Nature journal (NHB/NCS) | Hybrid OA (~€9,500 APC); apply for APC waiver if low-income affiliation; check if institution has Springer Nature agreement |
| ASR/AJS/Demography target | Post preprint to SocArXiv (all allow preprints); journal version paywalled unless paying hybrid OA |
| Institutional read & publish deal | Check library portal — many universities have Springer/Elsevier/Wiley agreements that cover APCs |
| No funding for APC | SocArXiv/SSRN preprint provides open access; sufficient for most community visibility |

**Preprint server guide**:

| Server | Field | URL |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **SocArXiv** | Sociology, social science | osf.io/preprints/socarxiv |
| **SSRN** | Social science, law, economics | ssrn.com |
| **arXiv** (cs.SI, cs.CY, stat.AP) | Computational social science | arxiv.org |
| **PsyArXiv** | Psychology | psyarxiv.com |
| **EarthArXiv / ESSOAr** | Environmental / earth science | eartharxiv.org |
| **bioRxiv / medRxiv** | Biology / health | biorxiv.org |

**APC waiver procedures**:
```
Nature journals waiver:
1. Submit paper; if accepted, go to OA billing page
2. Search author institutional affiliation
3. If institution has Springer Nature deal → covered
4. If LMIC affiliation → automatic waiver option
5. If NSF/NIH funded → upload grant number; publisher checks compliance

AAAS / Science Advances:
1. After acceptance, AAAS membership number can reduce fee
2. Waivers: submit written request to oa@aaas.org before APC invoice
```

## Step 5: REPLICATION PACKAGE AUDIT

Run this step to verify an existing replication package meets journal standards before submission.

### 5a. Audit Checklist

**Structure** (required by all journals):
- [ ] README.md present and complete (software versions, data sources, run order, expected output)
- [ ] Scripts numbered and named descriptively (01_clean, 02_analyze, 03_figures)
- [ ] All relative paths — no hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] Output files generated by scripts (not manually placed)
- [ ] Random seeds set and documented

**Run test** (do this before submission):
```bash
# Clone into a fresh directory and run from scratch
git clone [repo] test-replication
cd test-replication
# Restore environment
conda env create -f environment.yml  # OR: Rscript -e "renv::restore()"
# Run full pipeline
make all  # OR: run scripts in numbered order
# Check: all output files generated? All tables match paper?
```

**Data compliance**:
- [ ] No raw data with PII included
- [ ] Data availability statement matches what is actually deposited
- [ ] License file present
- [ ] CITATION.cff present

**Script archive integration** (if `output/[slug]/scripts/` was produced by scholar-analyze/compute/full-paper):
- [ ] Scripts from `output/[slug]/scripts/` incorporated into `code/` directory (not reconstructed from scratch)
- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` present in package root (copied from `coding-decisions-log.md`)
- [ ] All scripts have standard headers (purpose, input, output, date, seed)
- [ ] Script-index run-order table used to populate README

**Computational papers (NCS/Science Advances extras)**:
- [ ] environment.yml or renv.lock with pinned versions
- [ ] Docker file or documented container (for NCS)
- [ ] Model weights archived (Zenodo or HuggingFace Hub)
- [ ] Reporting Summary completed (NHB/NCS requirement)
- [ ] All figure error bars labeled with SE/SD/CI in caption

**Journal-specific extras**:

| Journal | Extra requirements |
|---------|-------------------|
| NCS | Docker; Reporting Summary; code ocean or GitHub; FAIR data statement |
| NHB | Ethics statement; ORCID for all authors; Reporting Summary |
| Science Advances | AAAS OA compliance; full methods + supplementary |
| ASR | AEA/AEJ-style data availability form (emerging) |
| Demography | Population Association data sharing policy |

---

## Step 6: Save Output

Use the Write tool to save three files:

```bash
# Determine output slug and date
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SLUG=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | cut -c1-40)
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs"
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-open-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-open-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-open --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-open-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-open
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [slug] and [YYYY-MM-DD] with actuals before running
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# BASE pattern: ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/preregistration-[slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
OUTDIR="$(dirname "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/preregistration-[slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/preregistration-[slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
BASE=$(bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM" | awk -F= '/^BASE=/{print $2; exit}')

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$BASE")"


echo "SAVE_PATH=${BASE}.md"
echo "BASE=${BASE}"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file. The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).

**File 1** — Preregistration document (if PREREGISTER mode):
```
Write tool → output/[slug]/preregistration-[SLUG]-[DATE].md
Contents: Complete preregistration document from Step 1d / 1e
```

**File 2** — Data Management Plan (if FULL-PACKAGE or DMP mode):
```
Write tool → output/[slug]/dmp-[SLUG]-[DATE].md
Contents: Completed DMP template from Step 4a
```

**File 3** — Replication Package README:
```
Write tool → output/[slug]/replication-readme-[SLUG]-[DATE].md
Contents: README.md template from Step 3b, filled in for this specific project
```

**Close Process Log:**

Run the following to finalize the process log:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-open"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t "${OUTPUT_ROOT}"/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
cat >> "$LOG_FILE" << LOGFOOTER

## Output Files
[list each output file path as a bullet]

## Summary
- **Steps completed**: [N completed]/[N total]
- **Files produced**: [count]
- **Errors**: [count, or 0]
- **Time finished**: $(date +%H:%M:%S)
LOGFOOTER
echo "Process log saved to $LOG_FILE"
```

After saving, print:
```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 SCHOLAR-OPEN: Output saved
 ├─ output/[slug]/preregistration-[slug]-[date].md
 ├─ output/[slug]/dmp-[slug]-[date].md
 └─ output/[slug]/replication-readme-[slug]-[date].md
