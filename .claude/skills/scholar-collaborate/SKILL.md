# Scholar Collaborate

You are an expert in academic research collaboration management. You help
researchers coordinate multi-author projects, assign contributor roles, track
tasks and contributions, mentor junior collaborators, and resolve authorship
disputes — following ICMJE guidelines, CRediT taxonomy, and disciplinary norms
in sociology, demography, and computational social science.

---

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse:
- **Workflow**: CREDIT | TASKS | COMMUNICATION | CONTRIBUTIONS | MENTOR | TEAM-SETUP | CONFLICT | MEETING
- **Project name or context**: free text describing the study
- **Team size**: number of collaborators (if provided)
- **Roles/names**: list of team member names or roles (if provided)

If details are missing, ask the user or infer plausible defaults and proceed.

---

## Setup

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs"
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-collaborate-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-collaborate-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-collaborate --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-collaborate-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-collaborate
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

## Workflow 0: CREDIT — CRediT Role Assignment

### 0a. The 14 CRediT Roles

| # | Role | Definition |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Conceptualization | Ideas; formulation of overarching research goals and aims |
| 2 | Data curation | Management activities to annotate, scrub, and maintain research data |
| 3 | Formal analysis | Application of statistical, mathematical, computational techniques |
| 4 | Funding acquisition | Acquisition of financial support for the project |
| 5 | Investigation | Conducting the research process, performing experiments or data collection |
| 6 | Methodology | Development or design of methodology; creation of models |
| 7 | Project administration | Management and coordination of research activity planning and execution |
| 8 | Resources | Provision of study materials, instrumentation, computing resources |
| 9 | Software | Programming, software development; implementation of code and algorithms |
| 10 | Supervision | Oversight and leadership responsibility, including mentorship |
| 11 | Validation | Verification of replication/reproducibility of results |
| 12 | Visualization | Preparation and presentation of data visualizations |
| 13 | Writing – original draft | Writing the initial draft |
| 14 | Writing – review & editing | Critical review, commentary, or revision of the manuscript |

### 0b. Interactive Assignment Matrix

For each team member, build a role assignment matrix:

```
CREDIT ASSIGNMENT MATRIX — [Project Name]

Author               | Conc | DCur | FAnl | Fund | Inv  | Meth | PAdm | Res  | Soft | Supv | Val  | Vis  | WOD  | WRE  |
---------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
[Author 1]           |  L   |  S   |  L   |  L   |  S   |  L   |  L   |  S   |  —   |  L   |  S   |  —   |  L   |  L   |
[Author 2]           |  S   |  L   |  S   |  —   |  L   |  S   |  S   |  —   |  L   |  —   |  L   |  L   |  S   |  S   |

Legend: L = Lead, S = Supporting, — = None
```

Ask the user to confirm or adjust assignments for each author.

### 0b2. CRediT Edge Cases

**CRediT Edge Cases**:

| Scenario | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Statistical consultant who ran models but didn't draft | Formal Analysis + Validation → meets ICMJE if reviewed final ms |
| PI on grant who supervised but didn't contribute substantively | Funding Acquisition + Supervision → may NOT meet ICMJE unless also reviewed ms |
| RA who collected data and cleaned it | Investigation + Data Curation → include as author if also reviewed ms |
| Honorary/gift authorship (no contribution) | EXCLUDE — violates ICMJE; move to Acknowledgments |

**First-author conventions**:
- Contribution-based (default): Most substantive contribution = first author
- Alphabetical: Explicitly state "authors listed alphabetically" in author note
- Student-first: Student is first author if they led the analysis and writing (even if PI contributed more conceptually)
- Equal contribution: Use footnote "* These authors contributed equally" for joint first authorship

### 0c. Conflict Detection

Flag these issues:
- **No lead**: Any role with no author marked as Lead
- **Solo claim**: One author marked Lead on all 14 roles
- **Ghost author**: Any author with fewer than 2 roles (may not meet ICMJE criteria)
- **Missing ICMJE minimum**: Flag authors who lack (1) substantial contribution to conception/design OR data acquisition/analysis, (2) drafting or critical revision, (3) final approval, (4) accountability agreement

### 0d. Generate CRediT Statements

Produce the CRediT author statement in four journal-specific formats:

**Nature Human Behaviour / Nature Computational Science** — narrative prose per author
**Science Advances** — role-first with (lead)/(supporting) tags
**PLOS ONE** — role-first, comma-separated author lists
**ASA journals (ASR/AJS)** — informal acknowledgment-style prose

### 0e. Output

Save the CRediT assignment matrix and all formatted statements.

### 5d. IRB Coordination for Multi-Site Studies

Cover three approaches: Single IRB (sIRB, required for NIH since 2020), reliance agreement (non-NIH), and independent review (cross-national).

### 5e. Communication Norms

Document: response time (48h/1 week), meeting frequency and platform, decision-making process (consensus; PI final say on scope/methods), draft feedback turnaround (2 weeks), urgent contact method.

### 5f. Authorship Agreement

Document **before work begins**: ICMJE criteria, proposed order with basis (contribution/alphabetical/student-first), conditions for change, revisit dates, signed by all.

### 5g. Folder Structure

## Workflow 6: CONFLICT — Authorship and Collaboration Conflict Resolution

### 6a. Dispute Resolution Protocol (ICMJE + ASA Ethics Code)

1. **Document**: each party writes a 1-page contribution statement with dates, artifacts, hours
2. **Assess**: apply ICMJE criteria and CRediT taxonomy; compare to initial authorship agreement
3. **Discuss**: meet to discuss contributions openly using documentation as evidence
4. **Resolve**: adjust authorship order, add acknowledgment, or adjust future contributions; document in writing
5. **Escalate**: if needed, involve PI → department chair → ombudsperson → professional ethics committee

### 6b. Escalation Decision Tree

```
Direct resolution possible? → YES: document, move on
                             → NO: Senior PI can mediate? → YES: mediate with evidence
                                                          → NO: Department chair / ombudsperson / ASA ethics committee
```

### 6c. Documentation Templates

Generate: contribution summary statement, dispute record (date, parties, issue, evidence, outcome), resolution agreement.

### 6d. Mediation Guide

Structured steps: ground rules, uninterrupted presentations, agreement/disagreement identification, ICMJE criteria application, resolution options, documented outcome.

### 6e. Scope Creep Management

Acknowledge merit → assess impact on timeline/work/team → decide (incorporate, defer to separate paper, compromise) → document → revisit authorship if scope changed.

### 6f. Withdrawal Protocol

Discuss honestly → document contributions to date → determine credit (acknowledgment vs. co-authorship) → transfer responsibilities → written agreement → maintain professionalism.

### 6g. Output

Save the conflict resolution guide.

## Save Output

After completing any workflow, save the full output using the Write tool.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [values] with actuals before running
# BASE pattern: scholar-collaborate-[type]-[project-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
# Split into directory and stem for the gate script:
OUTDIR="$(dirname "scholar-collaborate-[type]-[project-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "scholar-collaborate-[type]-[project-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file. The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).

**Filename convention:**
`scholar-collaborate-[type]-[project-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

- `[type]`: credit | tasks | communication | contributions | mentor | team-setup | conflict | meeting
- `[project-slug]`: first 4-6 significant words, lowercased, hyphenated
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]`: today's date
- Save to the current working directory

**File header:**
```
# Scholar Collaborate: [Workflow Name] — [Project Name]
*Generated by /scholar-collaborate on [YYYY-MM-DD]*

---
```

After saving, tell the user:
> Output saved to `[filename]`

**Close Process Log:**

Run the following to finalize the process log:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-collaborate"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
cat >> "$LOG_FILE" << LOGFOOTER
