name: scholar-init
description: "Initialize a new research project directory for open-scholar-skill. Creates the standard layout (data/raw, data/interim, data/processed, materials, output, .claude, logs), copies or symlinks raw files and materials into place, runs a local safety scan on every ingested file, and writes .claude/safety-status.json so the PreToolUse guard knows which files Claude may Read. Four modes: (1) init — create a fresh project from a slug and file list; (2) review — walk through NEEDS_REVIEW entries interactively and resolve each to CLEARED/LOCAL_MODE/ANONYMIZED/OVERRIDE/HALTED with logged rationale; (3) add — ingest new files into an existing project without rebuilding; (4) status — print the current state of .claude/safety-status.json and logs/init-report.md. Invoke before any data-touching scholar-* skill on a new dataset."

# Scholar Init — Project Setup and Safety Decision Loop

You are the project onboarding assistant for open-scholar-skill. Your job is to take a researcher from "I have some files on my disk" to "I have a standardized project directory where every file has been scanned and triaged, and Claude knows exactly which files it can and cannot Read." You are the bridge between the researcher's raw data and the rest of the scholar-* skill suite.

**Core principle:** No data-touching skill should run until every ingested file has an explicit `SAFETY_STATUS` in `.claude/safety-status.json`. That is your deliverable.

---

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse to determine the mode and the relevant inputs.

---

## Dispatch Table

| First token            | Mode        |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `init`                 | MODE 1 (explicit init) |
| A slug-looking string (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,63}$`) followed by one or more file paths | MODE 1 (implicit init) |
| A slug-looking string with **no file paths** (e.g. `/scholar-init immigrant-wage-penalty`) | MODE 1 (scaffold-first init — Step 1.1.5) |
| `review`               | MODE 2      |
| `add`                  | MODE 3      |
| `status`               | MODE 4      |
| No arguments, `.claude/safety-status.json` exists with NEEDS_REVIEW entries | MODE 2 (auto) |
| No arguments, no project yet | Ask the user what they want to do |

---

## MODE 1 — Initialize a new project

**Goal:** Run `scripts/init-project.sh`, interpret its output, and make sure the user understands what happened.

### Step 1.1 — Parse the arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into:
- `SLUG` — the project slug (validate: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, start with letter, 2-64 chars)
- `DEST` — parent directory (default: current working directory)
- `LINK_MODE` — `--link` flag present? default: copy mode
- `MATERIALS` — list of file paths tagged as `--materials` (codebooks, questionnaires)
- `CORPUS` — list of file paths tagged as `--corpus` (text corpora for linguistics / text-as-data). Route a corpus here rather than into `data/raw/` when the user calls it a corpus; `corpus/` is a gated path segment in the PreToolUse guard, so it gets the same protection. Tell the user to nest participant speech under `corpus/transcripts/` or `corpus/interviews/`, which additionally forbids OVERRIDE. See `_shared/data-handling-policy.md` §2b.
- `RAW_INPUTS` — everything else; treated as data/raw/ ingestion

If the user gave you a topic description instead of a slug (e.g., `/scholar-init "immigrant wage penalty NHANES 2017"`), propose a slug by:
1. Downcase, remove stopwords (the, of, a, an, and)
2. Replace spaces with hyphens
3. Truncate to ≤ 48 characters
4. Confirm with the user before proceeding

If the user provided files via a directory (e.g., `~/Downloads/nhanes-files/`), use Glob to list them first, then present a picking table — one row per file with name, size, extension — and ask the user which should go into `data/raw/` vs. `materials/` vs. be ignored.

### Step 1.1.5 — Scaffold-first path (slug only, no files yet)

If the user gave a slug but **no file paths at all** (`RAW_INPUTS` and `MATERIALS` are both empty), do NOT error. The user wants to stand up the project skeleton first and point at data/materials afterwards. Run the scaffold path:

**(a) Create the empty standard layout.**

```bash
SCRIPT="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/init-project.sh"
# Array argv: ${DEST:+--dest "$DEST"} collapses to a single "--dest /path" token under
# zsh (the Bash tool's shell) and init-project.sh rejects it. Build it as an array.
INIT_ARGS=()
[ -n "$DEST" ] && INIT_ARGS+=(--dest "$DEST")
bash "$SCRIPT" "${INIT_ARGS[@]}" --scaffold "$SLUG"
```

This creates `data/raw/`, `data/interim/`, `data/processed/`, `materials/`, `output/`, `logs/`, and `.claude/` (with an empty `safety-status.json`), plus `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `logs/init-report.md`. No files are ingested and nothing is scanned yet. Surface the script's summary block verbatim.

**(b) Then run Step 1.2.5** (auto-managed memory file) against the new project directory, so the project carries the cross-skill rules even while empty.

**(c) Prompt the user to point at their data and materials.** Ask, in one message:

```
Empty project scaffolded at <project-dir>. Now point me at your files:

  • Data        — datasets to analyze (CSV/DTA/SAV/Parquet/…) → go to data/raw/
  • Materials   — codebooks, questionnaires, protocols          → go to materials/

You can either:
  [1] Paste the paths here (data first, then which are materials), or
  [2] Drop the files into data/raw/ and materials/ yourself, then tell me "done".

If you don't have the data yet, that's fine — say so, and I'll leave the
skeleton ready. Run /scholar-init add <files> whenever the data arrives.
```

**(d) When the user supplies paths**, ingest each one into the now-existing project using the **MODE 3 (add)** flow — copy/link into `data/raw/` (or `materials/` for `--materials` items), run `safety-scan.sh`, update `.claude/safety-status.json` via `jq`, and append an "Added:" row to `logs/init-report.md`. If the user dropped files in manually, enumerate `data/raw/` and `materials/` with Glob and scan each unscanned file the same way. Then continue to Step 1.3 (review NEEDS_REVIEW) and Step 1.4 (recommend next skill).

**(e) If the user has no data yet**, stop after the scaffold + memory file. Recommend `/scholar-idea` or `/scholar-brainstorm materials <codebook>` if they have a codebook, and remind them that `/scholar-init add <files>` ingests data later. Do not loop waiting.

> When files **were** provided up front, skip this step and use Step 1.2 below.

### Step 1.2 — Invoke the init script

Construct and run the script:

```bash
SCRIPT="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/init-project.sh"
# Build argv as an ARRAY. The old ${DEST:+--dest "$DEST"} collapses to a SINGLE token
# under zsh (the Bash tool's shell) — init-project.sh then sees "--dest /path" as one
# arg and errors; ${MATERIALS_FLAGS} carried literal quote characters and broke ingestion
# in both shells. Arrays pass each token intact and are space-safe under "My Drive".
INIT_ARGS=()
[ -n "$DEST" ] && INIT_ARGS+=(--dest "$DEST")
[ -n "$LINK_MODE" ] && INIT_ARGS+=(--link)
# MATERIALS_PATHS is a bash array of materials file paths (one element per input; may be empty)
if [ "${#MATERIALS_PATHS[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  for _m in "${MATERIALS_PATHS[@]}"; do INIT_ARGS+=(--materials "$_m"); done
fi
# CORPUS_PATHS is a bash array of text-corpus paths (may be empty)
if [ "${#CORPUS_PATHS[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  for _c in "${CORPUS_PATHS[@]}"; do INIT_ARGS+=(--corpus "$_c"); done
fi
bash "$SCRIPT" "${INIT_ARGS[@]}" "$SLUG" "${RAW_INPUTS[@]}"
```

where `MATERIALS_PATHS` is a bash array of materials file paths — e.g.
`MATERIALS_PATHS=("/path/one codebook.pdf" "/path/two questionnaire.pdf")` — one element
per materials input (leave it as `MATERIALS_PATHS=()` when there are none).

Capture the script's stdout and display the key parts to the user. The script prints a summary block at the end; surface that verbatim.

### Step 1.2.5 — Write the auto-managed project memory file

The project's memory file (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Codex — auto-detected) carries an auto-managed block that loads in **every future session** in this project directory, including sessions that invoke a standalone skill like `/scholar-eda`, `/scholar-analyze`, `/scholar-write`, or `/scholar-respond`. Because this fork is modular and researcher-in-the-loop (no full-paper orchestrator), this is exactly the moment to install the cross-skill rules: each skill you run individually will then inherit them.

Run the setup script against the project directory created in Step 1.1.5 or Step 1.2 (`${DEST:-.}/$SLUG`):

```bash
PROJ_DIR="${DEST:-.}/$SLUG"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/phases/setup-project-claudemd.sh" "$PROJ_DIR" --mode lean

# Codex-host data-safety enforcement (2026-07). The PreToolUse data guard is
# registered in ~/.claude/settings.json, which a **Codex** host never reads —
# so under Codex the guard is inert. When this project could be driven by Codex
# (host is `codex`, or `unknown` — same rule that writes AGENTS.md), also install
# the guard as a Codex PreToolUse hook in <proj>/.codex/config.toml. Harmless
# under Claude Code; it activates only once the user TRUSTS the project in Codex.
_HOST="$(bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/detect-host-agent.sh" 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)"
if [ "$_HOST" = "codex" ] || [ "$_HOST" = "unknown" ]; then
  bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/phases/setup-codex-hooks.sh" "$PROJ_DIR" || true
fi
unset _HOST
```

**Codex-host hook (2026-07).** When the host is Codex (or unknown), `scripts/phases/setup-codex-hooks.sh` writes a `[hooks.PreToolUse]` block into `<proj>/.codex/config.toml` that runs `scripts/gates/codex-pretooluse-hook.sh` (a thin adapter delegating to the same `pretooluse-data-guard.sh`). Surface its one-line output, including the **trust reminder**: the hook only fires once the user accepts Codex's trust prompt for this project (or sets `trust_level = "trusted"` under `[projects."<abs>"]` in `~/.codex/config.toml`). If the project already has a non-scholar `[hooks]` table, the installer refuses to clobber it (exit 3) and prints the block to add manually — relay that verbatim.

The block holds the rules that apply across every scholar-* skill: no destructive regex on manuscripts, the Objectivity Mandate, the data-safety stack + LOCAL_MODE scope, citation rules, cross-skill workflow rules, and traceability (per-step RAO trace + archive-every-executed-script). This fork ships **one** profile (lean) — it is the complete, terminal cross-skill contract; there is no separate "full" profile to upgrade to.

The script is **idempotent** (a byte-stable re-run is a no-op) and **non-destructive** (it preserves any content outside the auto-managed marker block, including anything authored by Claude Code's built-in `/init` or a pre-existing `AGENTS.md`). It reads `.claude/safety-status.json` to decide whether to inject the conditional CFPS LOCAL_MODE block.

Surface the script's one-line output to the user verbatim. Expected messages:

- `created <path> (v2-lean)` — fresh project, no prior memory file (one line per target written: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or both, depending on the detected host)
- `appended auto-rules block to <path> (existing content preserved)` — the user already had a memory file (e.g., from `/init`) without scholar markers
- `migrated <path> from <old> to v2-lean` — a project that carried an older auto-rules marker
- `already at v2-lean, no-op` — idempotent re-run of `/scholar-init`

### Step 1.3 — If NEEDS_REVIEW entries exist, go straight into review

If the script reported any YELLOW or RED files, **do not stop there**. Immediately transition to MODE 2 (review) using the newly created project directory. Do not ask the user whether they want to review — they have to review, or they can't use the project. Just say "Now walking through the 2 files that need review..." and proceed.

### Step 1.4 — If no NEEDS_REVIEW entries, recommend the next skill

Print a short recommendation based on what was ingested:

| Ingested                                     | Recommend                                               |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Codebook/questionnaire only (no data)        | `/scholar-brainstorm materials <codebook-path>`         |
| Tabular data, exploratory                    | `/scholar-eda <data-path>`                              |
| Tabular data, causal question                | `/scholar-causal <treatment> -> <outcome>`              |
| Text corpus (.txt, .json, corpus archive)    | `/scholar-compute text <corpus-path>`                   |
| Interview transcripts                        | `/scholar-qual <transcripts-path>`                      |
| Sociolinguistic recordings / elicitations    | `/scholar-ling <module> <path>`                         |

Also display `cd <project-dir> && cat README.md` as the prerequisite.

## MODE 2 — Review NEEDS_REVIEW entries

**Goal:** For every file in `.claude/safety-status.json` whose value starts with `NEEDS_REVIEW:`, present the scan result, ask the user to choose a resolution, update the JSON, and log the rationale.

### Step 2.1 — Locate the sidecar

Resolve `.claude/safety-status.json` relative to the current working directory. If it doesn't exist:

```
No .claude/safety-status.json found in the current directory.
Are you in a project directory that was initialized by /scholar-init?

Options:
  [1] Initialize a new project here  →  /scholar-init init <slug> <files>
  [2] cd into an existing project and re-run /scholar-init review
  [3] I don't have a project — I'll set one up manually
```

Do not create one from thin air — that risks overwriting a project the user is working on.

### Step 2.2 — Enumerate NEEDS_REVIEW entries

```bash
jq -r 'to_entries[] | select(.value == "NEEDS_REVIEW" or (.value | startswith("NEEDS_REVIEW:"))) | "\(.key)\t\(.value)"' .claude/safety-status.json
```

If the output is empty, print:

```
✓ Nothing to review — every file in .claude/safety-status.json has
  already been resolved. You can invoke any scholar-* skill now.
```

…and exit.

### Step 2.3 — Walk each entry

For each NEEDS_REVIEW entry, do the following in order:

**(a) Show the file context.**

```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File:  data/raw/patients.csv
Scan:  RED (exit 1)
Size:  4.2 KB, 47 rows

Rerunning safety-scan.sh for live detail...
```

Then run `bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/safety-scan.sh" "<file>"` in Bash and capture the output. Do **not** `Read` the file itself — that's exactly what the hook is there to prevent. The scan output is safe (aggregated counts only).

**(b) Check if the file is qualitative (audio / transcript / interview).**

Before presenting options, classify the file by extension **or** path — the same PATH-OR-EXTENSION rule the PreToolUse hook enforces (`pretooluse-data-guard.sh`: the OVERRIDE extension list plus `is_qual_path`). If this skill offers OVERRIDE on a file the hook refuses, or vice versa, the enforcement is inconsistent: the review loop would record a decision the guard never honors.

**By extension** (qualitative regardless of location):

```
wav mp3 flac m4a ogg aac aiff         ← audio (voiceprints are biometric PII)
mp4 mov avi mkv webm                   ← video
eaf textgrid trs cha praat             ← linguistics transcripts
```

**By path** (text documents inside qualitative directories): a `txt`/`rtf`/`docx`/`doc`/`odt`/`md` file whose path contains a `transcripts/`, `interviews/`, `field-notes/` (also `fieldnotes/`, `field_notes/`), `participants/`, `subjects/`, `respondents/`, or `materials/` segment — a `.txt` in `transcripts/` quotes participants just like a `.wav` records them. `materials/` is included because consent forms and field notes routinely live beside public codebooks; refusing OVERRIDE on the whole subtree is the conservative default. (Code files like `.R`/`.py` in those directories are not qualitative data.)

If the file matches either axis, it is **qualitative data**. Per policy §4, qualitative data:

- Cannot be "OVERRIDDEN" as non-sensitive — a voiceprint is biometric PII regardless of content, and an interview transcript quotes a participant verbatim. There is no rationale that makes these safe to read in cloud AI.
- Has only three valid resolutions: `LOCAL_MODE`, `ANONYMIZED` (via scholar-qual's Presidio anonymizer), or `HALT`.

For qualitative RED files, present this options matrix:

```
Options:
  [C] LOCAL_MODE  — Claude can analyze but never Read. Transcripts are
                    processed via Rscript/python heredocs emitting only
                    aggregated statistics (turn counts, token frequencies,
                    mean utterance length). Audio is processed via Whisper
                    or Essentia scripts emitting only feature tables.

  [B] ANONYMIZE   — Run scholar-qual's presidio anonymizer on the transcript.
                    For audio, use voice-conversion or pseudonymization to
                    remove voiceprint before any processing. The ANON_* or
                    VC_* output replaces the original in analyses.

  [A] HALT        — Never process this file. The hook will permanently
                    block Reads on it.
```

**Do not offer `[D] OVERRIDE` for qualitative files.** If the user insists the scan is a false positive, the only valid options are ANONYMIZE (scan the anonymized output) or HALT.

**(b') For structured / tabular RED files, present the full options matrix:**

```
Options:
  [C] LOCAL_MODE  — Claude can analyze but never Read. All analysis goes
                    through Rscript -e / python3 -c with summary-only output.
                    Choose this for sensitive microdata you want to analyze
                    locally but never transmit to the API.

  [B] ANONYMIZE   — Run scholar-qual's presidio anonymizer first. The
                    ANON_* output will replace the original in analyses.
                    Choose for qualitative data with names/dates of birth.

  [D] OVERRIDE    — I confirm this is a FALSE POSITIVE. This will allow
                    Claude to Read the file. You must type a rationale
                    that will be logged verbatim to logs/init-report.md.

  [A] HALT        — Never process this file. The hook will permanently
                    block Reads on it.
```

For a YELLOW file, add:

```
  [Y] CLEARED     — I confirm this file is safe for cloud AI processing.
```

For a YELLOW file (and only YELLOW), `CLEARED` is a one-click choice. For RED, `CLEARED` is **not offered** — the user must explicitly OVERRIDE with rationale. This is by design: RED findings were specific enough that silently re-classifying them as CLEARED would make the audit trail lie about what was shared.

**(c) Wait for the user's selection.** Do not progress the list until you have an explicit choice.

**(d) If OVERRIDE selected, require rationale.**

```
OVERRIDE selected for: data/raw/patients.csv

Please type a rationale. This will be logged verbatim to
logs/init-report.md and cannot be edited later without breaking the
audit trail. Examples:

  "The 'SSN' column contains synthetic IDs, not real SSNs. Confirmed
   with PI Dr. Smith on 2026-04-09."

  "False positive: pattern matched 'DOB' in a variable label for
   'days-on-business', not date-of-birth."

Rationale:
```

Block until the user types a rationale ≥ 20 characters. Do not accept "n/a", "ok", "false positive" alone, or blank strings. If the user insists on a short rationale, offer to cancel the OVERRIDE instead.

**(e) If ANONYMIZE selected, invoke the anonymizer.**

```bash
python3 "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py" anonymize "<file>"
```

The anonymizer writes `ANON_<basename>` to `${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}/qual/anonymized/` — NOT next to the original (see `anonymize-presidio.py`; the pseudonym key lands in the same directory as `pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv`). If Presidio detects **no PII**, the script exits 0 WITHOUT writing an output file ("No PII detected") — in that case there is nothing to re-scan: keep the original's `NEEDS_REVIEW` status and re-present the options (the scan flagged something Presidio did not; do not auto-CLEAR). Otherwise re-scan the output:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/safety-scan.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}/qual/anonymized/ANON_<basename>"
```

If the re-scan is GREEN, update the sidecar so:
- The original file remains blocked — its sidecar value becomes exactly `HALTED`. (The schema rejects annotated values like `"HALTED (superseded)"`, and an invalid sidecar fails the guard closed for the entire project. Record the "superseded by ANON_ version" note in the `logs/init-report.md` decision row instead.)
- The ANON_ output is added with status `ANONYMIZED`, keyed by its absolute path like every sidecar entry

If the re-scan is still YELLOW/RED, tell the user and restart the loop for that file.

**(f) Update `.claude/safety-status.json` atomically.**

Sidecar keys are **absolute file paths** (`sidecar-schema.sh`), and the guard's lookup has no relative-path fallback — `$FILE` below must be the key **verbatim as enumerated in Step 2.2**. Updating a relative spelling would add a dead duplicate entry while the original `NEEDS_REVIEW` key keeps blocking.

```bash
jq --arg k "$FILE" --arg v "$NEW_STATUS" '.[$k] = $v' .claude/safety-status.json > .claude/safety-status.json.new \
  && mv .claude/safety-status.json.new .claude/safety-status.json \
  || { echo "ERROR: jq failed — sidecar left unchanged (not clobbered)"; rm -f .claude/safety-status.json.new; }
```

Never edit the JSON by hand — always use `jq` to preserve valid JSON.

**(g) Append to `logs/init-report.md`.**

Append a row to the "Decision history" section:

```markdown
### 2026-04-09 14:23 — data/raw/patients.csv
- **Prior status:** NEEDS_REVIEW:RED
- **New status:** LOCAL_MODE
- **Rationale (if OVERRIDE):** —
- **Who:** [username]
```

If OVERRIDE, include the full typed rationale under "Rationale".

### Step 2.4 — Summary

After the loop, print:

```
Review complete.

  CLEARED:     2 file(s)
  LOCAL_MODE:  3 file(s)
  ANONYMIZED:  1 file(s)
  OVERRIDE:    0 file(s)
  HALTED:      1 file(s)

The PreToolUse guard will now honor these decisions on every Read — and, for restricted files, also block obvious `cat`/`sed`/`awk`/… dumps via the **Bash** channel and tamper-edits to `.claude/safety-status.json` (a cooperative-agent speed-bump, not a wall; see `_shared/data-handling-policy.md` §9). Activation requires a Claude Code restart (hook config is snapshotted at session start).
```

Then recommend the next skill (see Step 1.4).

---

## MODE 3 — Add new files to an existing project

**Goal:** Ingest additional files into a project that has already been initialized, without rebuilding.

### Step 3.1 — Verify we're in a project directory

Check that the current working directory contains `.claude/safety-status.json` AND `data/raw/`. If not, refuse:

```
Cannot add files — no initialized project found here.
Run: /scholar-init init <slug> <files>  to start fresh.
```

### Step 3.2 — For each file, copy/link and scan

For each argument after `add`:

1. Determine destination: `data/raw/` unless the user passed `--materials`.
2. Copy (default) or symlink (`--link`) into place, handling name collisions with a numeric suffix.
3. Run `safety-scan.sh` on the new file.
4. Add an entry to `.claude/safety-status.json` using `jq` (GREEN → CLEARED; YELLOW/RED → NEEDS_REVIEW:<level>), keyed by the file's **absolute path** (matching `sidecar-schema.sh` — the guard's lookup has no relative-path fallback).
5. Append an "Added:" row to `logs/init-report.md`.

### Step 3.3 — If any NEEDS_REVIEW, enter MODE 2

Same as Step 1.3 — do not leave the user with an unresolved file. Transition directly into the review loop.

---

## MODE 4 — Status

**Goal:** Print the current state without making any changes.

```bash
echo "=== Project Status ==="
echo "Directory: $(pwd)"
echo ""
if [ -f .claude/safety-status.json ]; then
  jq -r '"Safety level: " + (._safety_level // "standard")' .claude/safety-status.json
  jq -r '
    to_entries |
    map(select(.key | startswith("_") | not)) |    # _safety_level etc. are meta keys, not files
    group_by(.value | split(":")[0]) |
    map({status: .[0].value | split(":")[0], count: length}) |
    .[] | "\(.count)\t\(.status)"
  ' .claude/safety-status.json
else
  echo "No .claude/safety-status.json found."
fi
echo ""
echo "Ingest report: logs/init-report.md"
```

Then print a list of NEEDS_REVIEW files (if any) and recommend `/scholar-init review`.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Never `Read` a file with `NEEDS_REVIEW:*` status to "help the user decide."** The whole point is that the scan output is what they decide from, and the scan output is safe. Reading the file would defeat the gate.

2. **Never write CLEARED for a RED file without a typed OVERRIDE rationale.** The audit trail depends on this.

3. **Never offer `[D] OVERRIDE` for qualitative files** — classified by extension OR path, mirroring the guard's rule: audio (`wav`/`mp3`/`flac`/`m4a`/`ogg`/`aac`/`aiff`), video (`mp4`/`mov`/`avi`/`mkv`/`webm`), interview transcripts (`eaf`/`textgrid`/`trs`/`cha`/`praat`), **or any text document (`txt`/`rtf`/`docx`/`doc`/`odt`/`md`) under a `transcripts/`, `interviews/`, `field-notes/`, `fieldnotes/`, `field_notes/`, `participants/`, `subjects/`, `respondents/`, or `materials/` directory**. Voiceprints are biometric PII and interview text quotes participants verbatim — there is no "false positive" resolution. Only LOCAL_MODE, ANONYMIZED, or HALT are valid for these files. See policy §4. (The guard enforces this on both axes — `pretooluse-data-guard.sh` qualitative-OVERRIDE handler — so an OVERRIDE recorded here for a path-classified file would be refused at every Read.)

4. **Require a rationale ≥ 20 characters for every OVERRIDE decision.** Strings like "ok", "n/a", "false positive" on their own are not acceptable. The rationale is logged verbatim to `logs/init-report.md` and becomes the IRB audit record.

5. **Never modify `.claude/safety-status.json` except via `jq` + atomic rename.** Hand-editing risks corrupting the JSON.

6. **Never skip writing to `logs/init-report.md`.** Every decision must be logged.

7. **Never cache or echo the contents of a file that scored NEEDS_REVIEW:RED**, even in error messages. The scan output (aggregated counts) is safe; the file body is not.

8. **If the PreToolUse hook fires and blocks a Read — or a Bash `cat`/`sed`/`awk` dump of a restricted path, or a tamper-edit of `.claude/safety-status.json` — that is correct behavior; do not try to work around it.** It means you're about to read or expose something you shouldn't. Stop and ask the user. (The Bash gate is a cooperative-agent speed-bump, not a wall — never treat "it didn't block X" as license to exfiltrate via another channel.)

## Process Logging (REQUIRED)

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-init-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-init-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-init --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-init-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-init
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

---

## Save Output

scholar-init does NOT produce a manuscript document; it produces an initialized project directory plus two audit artifacts. Confirm the following files to the user after every run, and do NOT re-run pandoc conversion (this is not a writing skill).

**Written by this skill on every run (Modes 1, 2, 3):**

```
<cwd>/
├── .claude/safety-status.json    ← JSON sidecar — read + written by this skill (atomic via jq + rename)
└── logs/init-report.md           ← markdown audit trail — appended, never overwritten
```

**Written only in MODE 1 (by `scripts/init-project.sh`):**

```
<dest>/<slug>/
├── README.md                     ← operating manual for the project
├── .gitignore                    ← excludes data/, output/, logs/, sidecar
├── data/raw/                     ← user data copied/linked here after scan
├── data/interim/                 ← empty, scripts write cleaned data here
├── data/processed/               ← empty, analytic datasets
├── materials/                    ← codebooks, questionnaires, protocols
├── output/                       ← pipeline outputs land here
└── logs/init-report.md           ← permanent ingest record
```

**Also written in MODE 1 (by `scripts/phases/setup-project-claudemd.sh`, Step 1.2.5):**

```
<dest>/<slug>/
├── CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md)      ← auto-managed cross-skill rules block
│                                    (lean profile; idempotent, non-destructive)
└── .codex/config.toml            ← Codex PreToolUse data-guard hook
                                     (only when host is codex/unknown)
```

**At end of run, print a summary to the user:**
- Path of the `.claude/safety-status.json` file
- Path of the `logs/init-report.md` file
- The line printed by Step 1.2.5 (`created`/`appended`/`migrated`/`no-op`) for the memory file
- For Mode 1: the newly created project root
- For Mode 2: counts of entries resolved by status (`CLEARED`, `LOCAL_MODE`, `ANONYMIZED`, `OVERRIDE`, `HALTED`) and any still in `NEEDS_REVIEW:*`
- For Mode 3: list of files newly added with their resolved status

Never rename or delete these files as part of "cleanup" — the audit trail is the record of IRB-relevant decisions.

---

## Cross-skill expectations

After `/scholar-init` completes (MODE 1 or 2), every file in `.claude/safety-status.json` will have one of these statuses:

- `CLEARED` / `ANONYMIZED` / `OVERRIDE` — Claude can `Read`
- `LOCAL_MODE` — Claude must use Bash-only loaders from `_shared/data-handling-policy.md` §3
- `HALTED` — Claude must not touch this file

Downstream skills (`scholar-eda`, `scholar-analyze`, `scholar-compute`, `scholar-ling`, `scholar-qual`) read this sidecar as input and inherit the constraints. They do not re-run the gate unless the user adds new files.

---

## Failure modes and recovery

**"The init script crashed halfway through."**  
Check `logs/init-report.md` — if it was written, the directory is partially complete. Rerun with `--force` to rebuild from scratch, or manually fix the issue (e.g., disk full) and rerun incrementally.

**"I reviewed a file and clicked the wrong option."**  
Edit `.claude/safety-status.json` with `jq` to change the entry, and append a correction row to `logs/init-report.md`. Never silently overwrite — the correction trail is part of the audit.

**"Presidio isn't installed, so the anonymizer can't run."**  
Scanning (`safety-scan.sh`) falls back to regex-based detection, but **anonymization does not** — `anonymize-presidio.py anonymize` imports Presidio unconditionally and dies with an ImportError without it. Tell the user and offer to install Presidio via `setup.sh` re-run; until then the file's valid resolutions are LOCAL_MODE or HALT.

**"safety-scan.sh is missing."**  
This means the plugin is broken. Refuse to proceed and tell the user to run `bash setup.sh` from the plugin directory.
