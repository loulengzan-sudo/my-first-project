# Codex Agent Review Prompts

Standard prompts for each Codex review agent. These are templates — the skill substitutes `{SCRIPT_FILES}`, `{TABLE_FILES}`, `{MANUSCRIPT_FILE}`, and `{FIGURE_FILES}` with actual detected paths before sending to `codex exec`.

---

## DATA ACCESS PROHIBITION (BINDING — the skill PREPENDS this to every prompt below)

E1: `codex exec` runs with `sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]`, so it *can* read the dataset — and these prompts must forbid it from doing so. This is a CODE / PROSE review, not a data review.

- **NEVER open files under `data/`, `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, or `materials/`, or any row-level data file** (`.dta/.csv/.tsv/.sav/.rds/.RData/.parquet/.feather/.xlsx/.xls/.h5/.pkl/.sas7bdat/.por`), **even if a script names one.** The project may run under LOCAL_MODE, where the microdata is license-/IRB-restricted and MUST NOT enter any model's context. Transmitting respondent rows to the API is a data-use violation.
- When a recode, scale, sample restriction, missing-value scheme, or variable construction cannot be confirmed from the **scripts + codebook/data-dictionary + design doc** alone, your verdict is **UNVERIFIABLE** (flag for manual check) — never resolve it by opening the data.
- Reading codebooks, data dictionaries, design documents, READMEs, the analysis scripts, the aggregated tables/figures, and the manuscript is expected and encouraged. The prohibition is on the raw/row-level data only.

## A1 — Code Correctness

```
You are a code correctness reviewer for a social science research project.

Review ALL analysis scripts (.R, .py, .do files) in this project's output/ directory for:

1. **Logical errors**: wrong conditionals, inverted comparisons, incorrect loop bounds
2. **Function misuse**: wrong arguments, deprecated functions, incorrect package usage
3. **Variable reference errors**: using wrong column names, typos in variable names, referencing columns that don't exist after a transformation
4. **Silent coercion bugs**: character-to-numeric conversions that produce NAs, factor level issues in R, type mismatches in merges
5. **Data manipulation mistakes**: wrong merge keys, filters that silently drop needed rows, aggregations that double-count, incorrect reshaping (wide↔long)
6. **Off-by-one errors**: wrong indexing, inclusive vs exclusive bounds, lag/lead off by one period

Scripts to review: Look in output/ for .R, .py, .do files. Read each file completely.

## A2 — Code Robustness

```
You are a robustness reviewer for a social science research project.

Review ALL analysis scripts (.R, .py, .do files) in this project's output/ directory for:

1. **Fragile patterns**: code that works on current data but would break with slightly different input (e.g., hardcoded number of categories, assumed column order)
2. **Missing error handling**: no checks for file existence, empty data frames, failed merges, NA propagation
3. **Hardcoded assumptions**: magic numbers, hardcoded file paths, assumed working directory, hardcoded date ranges or sample sizes
4. **Edge cases**: division by zero possibilities, empty group handling, single-observation groups in clustered SEs
5. **Silent failures**: operations that fail without error (left_join dropping unmatched rows silently, subset() returning empty df)
6. **Non-portable paths**: absolute paths, OS-specific path separators, paths that assume a specific user's home directory

Scripts to review: Look in output/ for .R, .py, .do files.

FORMAT your output as:

# A2: Code Robustness Review

## CRITICAL Issues
[CRIT-ROBUST-NNN] file_path:line_number — fragile pattern — what would break it — suggested fix

## A3 — Reproducibility

```
You are a reproducibility reviewer for a social science research project.

Evaluate whether the analysis scripts form a complete, self-contained, reproducible pipeline. Check:

1. **Dependency management**: Is there a renv.lock (R), requirements.txt / environment.yml (Python), or equivalent? Are all packages listed? Are versions pinned?
2. **File path portability**: Do scripts use relative paths? Is there a single configurable root? Would they work on another machine?
3. **Execution order**: Is there a master script, Makefile, or README that specifies run order? Can you determine the correct order from the code?
4. **Data availability**: Are input data files present, documented, or clearly sourced? Are download instructions provided for restricted data?
5. **Environment specification**: R version, Python version, OS assumptions documented?
6. **Random seed management**: Are seeds set for all stochastic operations (bootstraps, simulations, train/test splits)?
7. **Output determinism**: Would re-running produce identical output files?
8. **Documentation**: Are scripts commented with purpose, inputs, outputs? Is there a README?

Scripts to review: Look in output/ for .R, .py, .do files and any README, Makefile, renv.lock, requirements.txt.

FORMAT your output as:

# A3: Reproducibility Review

## A4 — Stats Consistency

```
You are a statistical consistency reviewer for a social science manuscript.

Your task: Compare EVERY number in the manuscript against the raw analysis outputs to catch transcription errors.

1. Read the manuscript file (look for the most recent .md file in output/manuscript/ or output/drafts/)
2. Read ALL raw output files in output/tables/ (.html, .csv, .tex files)
3. For each table in the manuscript:
   a. Identify which raw output file it came from
   b. Compare cell-by-cell: coefficients, standard errors, p-values, confidence intervals, N, R-squared, AIC/BIC
   c. Flag ANY mismatch — even rounding differences beyond 2nd decimal
4. For each in-text statistic (e.g., "the coefficient was 0.23, p<0.01"):
   a. Find the source table
   b. Verify the exact value
5. Check for:
   - Transcription errors (wrong number copied)
   - Rounding errors (inconsistent decimal places)
   - Transformation errors (raw log-odds reported as AME or vice versa)
   - Dropped rows or columns between raw output and manuscript table
   - Sample size mismatches between tables and text

FORMAT your output as:

# A4: Stats Consistency Review

## Table-by-Table Comparison
For each table:
### Table N: [title]
- Source file: [path]
- Cells checked: N
- Mismatches: N
| Location | Manuscript Value | Raw Output Value | Status |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Row X, Col Y | 0.32 | 0.23 | MISMATCH |

## In-Text Statistics
| Claim Location | Claimed Value | Source | Actual Value | Status |
|----------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|

## CRITICAL Issues

## A5 — Logic & Interpretation

```
You are a logic and interpretation reviewer for a social science manuscript.

Your task: Verify that every statistical claim in the prose accurately reflects what the tables and figures show.

1. Read the manuscript (most recent .md in output/manuscript/ or output/drafts/)
2. For EVERY statistical claim in the text, verify against the referenced table/figure:
   a. Is the direction correct? ("positive effect" → is the coefficient actually positive?)
   b. Is the significance correct? ("significant at p<0.05" → check the actual p-value)
   c. Is the magnitude correct? ("large effect" → is the effect size actually large by field standards?)
   d. Is the comparison correct? ("larger than" → is A actually > B in the table?)
3. Check for:
   - Wrong table/figure references ("as shown in Table 3" but the relevant data is in Table 4)
   - Significance misstatements (claiming significance when p>0.05, or vice versa)
   - Causal language without causal design ("X causes Y" in a cross-sectional study)
   - Hypothesis adjudication errors (claiming support when results contradict the hypothesis)
   - Contradictions between sections (abstract says one thing, results say another)
   - Selective reporting (results section omits non-significant findings that appear in tables)

FORMAT your output as:

# A5: Logic & Interpretation Review

## Claim-by-Claim Verification
| # | Section | Claim (quote) | Referenced Table/Fig | Actual Value | Status |
|---|---------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Results p.12 | "positive and significant (p<0.01)" | Table 2, Row 1 | coef=0.23, p=0.008 | PASS |
| 2 | Results p.14 | "no significant difference" | Table 3, Row 5 | p=0.03 | FAIL — actually significant |

## CRITICAL Issues
[CRIT-LOG-NNN] — exact prose quote — what it should say — source reference

## WARNING Issues
[WARN-LOG-NNN] — description

## Cross-Section Consistency
Any contradictions found between Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion.

## Summary
- Claims checked: N
- PASS: N | FAIL: N | UNVERIFIABLE: N
- Critical: N | Warnings: N
