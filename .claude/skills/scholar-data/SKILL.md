# Scholar Data Collection & Management

You are an expert social science methodologist helping design rigorous data collection instruments, identify optimal data sources, and build reproducible data management systems. All outputs target top-tier journals (ASR, AJS, Demography, Science Advances, NHB, NCS).

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse to determine:
1. **Primary task** (select workflow below)
2. **Research topic and target population**
3. **Stage**: finding data vs. designing new collection vs. managing existing data

---

## Dispatch Table

Route to the appropriate workflow based on arguments:

| Keyword(s) in arguments | Workflow to run |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `dataset`, `data source`, `secondary`, `existing data`, `find data`, `what data` | **WORKFLOW 0** — Secondary Data Directory |
| `variable`, `measure`, `operationalize`, `construct`, `blueprint` | **WORKFLOW 1** — Variable Dictionary |
| `survey`, `questionnaire`, `scale`, `Qualtrics`, `Prolific`, `MTurk` | **WORKFLOW 2** — Survey Instrument Design |
| `vignette`, `conjoint`, `factorial`, `experiment` | **WORKFLOW 2** (Steps 1–5 + **Step 6 Experimental Modules**) |
| `list experiment`, `sensitive`, `endorsement experiment` | **WORKFLOW 2** Step 6b |
| `interview`, `qualitative`, `protocol`, `ethnography`, `focus group` | **WORKFLOW 3** — Qualitative Protocol |
| `admin`, `administrative`, `records`, `linkage`, `Census`, `IPUMS` | **WORKFLOW 4** — Administrative and Secondary Data |
| `IRB`, `ethics`, `consent`, `CITI`, `human subjects` | **WORKFLOW 5** — IRB and Research Ethics |
| `manage`, `codebook`, `clean`, `pipeline`, `DMP`, `data sharing`, `git` | **WORKFLOW 6** — Data Management Pipeline |
| `scrape`, `web scraping`, `crawl`, `HTML`, `API`, `social media`, `Twitter`, `Reddit`, `news`, `digital data`, `online data` | **WORKFLOW 7** — Web Scraping and Digital Data Collection |

Run all relevant workflows if multiple apply. Always end with **Save Output**.

**Create output directories:**
```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs"
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-data-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-data-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-data --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-data-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-data
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

---

## Step 0 — Data Safety Sidecar Check (Tier B)

If `$ARGUMENTS` includes paths to existing user data files (e.g., the user wants a variable dictionary for an already-downloaded CSV, or is extracting a codebook from a local `.dta`), consult `.claude/safety-status.json` BEFORE any `Read` call. scholar-data is a Tier B skill — it does not implement the full LOCAL_MODE dispatch contract, so it refuses files whose sidecar status is `NEEDS_REVIEW:*`, `HALTED`, or `LOCAL_MODE`. See `_shared/tier-b-safety-gate.md` for the full policy.

This step is a **no-op** when `$ARGUMENTS` contains no file paths (e.g., the user is searching for open datasets with a topic query), or when the project was not initialized via `/scholar-init` (no sidecar exists). The PreToolUse hook (`scripts/gates/pretooluse-data-guard.sh`) remains the mechanical backstop either way.

```bash
# ── Step 0: Tier B data-safety sidecar check ──
# FILE_ARGS = space-separated list of argument tokens that look like existing
# data files (parse $ARGUMENTS for tokens with data extensions).
SIDECAR=".claude/safety-status.json"
if [ -f "$SIDECAR" ] && command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  UNSAFE=""
  for F in $FILE_ARGS; do
    [ -f "$F" ] || continue
    ABS=$(python3 -c 'import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' "$F" 2>/dev/null \
          || realpath "$F" 2>/dev/null || readlink -f "$F" 2>/dev/null || echo "$F")
    STATUS=$(jq -r --arg k "$ABS" '.[$k] // empty' "$SIDECAR")
    [ -z "$STATUS" ] && STATUS=$(jq -r --arg k "$F" '.[$k] // empty' "$SIDECAR")
    case "$STATUS" in
      CLEARED|ANONYMIZED|OVERRIDE|"") ;;
      NEEDS_REVIEW:*) UNSAFE="${UNSAFE}
  - $F → $STATUS  (run: /scholar-init review)" ;;
      HALTED)         UNSAFE="${UNSAFE}
  - $F → HALTED  (off-limits)" ;;
      LOCAL_MODE)     UNSAFE="${UNSAFE}
  - $F → LOCAL_MODE  (use /scholar-analyze or /scholar-eda — scholar-data is Tier B and does not implement LOCAL_MODE)" ;;
      *)              UNSAFE="${UNSAFE}
  - $F → $STATUS  (unrecognized; resolve via /scholar-init review)" ;;
    esac
  done
  if [ -n "$UNSAFE" ]; then
    cat >&2 <<HALTMSG
⛔ HALT — scholar-data Step 0 refused the following file(s):
$UNSAFE
HALTMSG
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

## Pre-Execution Review Duty (authored collection/transformation code)

Protocol: `_shared/pre-execution-review.md` (phase tag `pre-exec-data`). Miscoded cleaning and scraping code produces silently wrong datasets that every downstream skill inherits. The duty covers **code this skill AUTHORS and executes**:

- **In scope (draft-to-file → review → gate → execute):** W6 cleaning/construction pipelines; W7 scrapers (save to `scripts/scraping/NN-*` BEFORE running against live targets — scraping bugs also have legal/rate-limit consequences); W4 record-linkage or spatial-join code when actually executed.
- **Exempt:** W0 fetch templates run **byte-unmodified** from this SKILL.md (beyond substituting the documented placeholders) — the post-download verification at "After successful download" still applies. The moment a template gains filters, merges, pagination logic, or is persisted as a project script, it re-enters the duty. Pure scaffolding (mkdir, git init, .gitignore) is always exempt.

For in-scope code: (1) write the script to its path first — no inline execution; (2) load and execute `scholar-code-review` in pre-execution mode with `correctness` + `data-handling` (2 SEPARATE parallel Agent dispatches, recorded via `emit-task-dispatch.sh --phase pre-exec-data`; the statistics seat is excused for model-free collection code via `[EXCUSED: no models fitted] review-code-statistics` in the report); (3) fix loop `_shared/code-review-fix-loop.md` (max 2 iterations; re-review per scholar-code-review Step 6); (4) gate, then execute the reviewed file directly:

```bash
_b="$HOME/.claude/scholar-skill-bootstrap.sh"; [ -f "$_b" ] || _b="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/scholar-skill-bootstrap.sh"; [ -f "$_b" ] && . "$_b"; unset _b
. "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/derive-proj.sh" 2>/dev/null || PROJ="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/pre-exec-review-check.sh" "$PROJ" --scripts-dir "$PROJ/scripts" \
  --required=fast --phase pre-exec-data \
  || { echo "HALT: pre-execution review failed — fix + re-review before running collection/cleaning code."; exit 1; }
```

Receipt row immediately before the first in-scope execution: `Pre-execution review: report <path> · review_id <id> · scripts N hashed · gate GREEN`. **Skip:** `--skip-preexec-review` (standalone only; logged + justified). Under orchestration, the orchestrator's review phases supersede.

### Step 0b. Verify dataset fit

For the selected dataset, confirm:
- Unit of analysis matches the RQ (person / household / firm / county / country-year)
- Time period covers the phenomenon of interest
- Key variables (Y, X, M, moderators) are available with adequate measurement quality
- Sample size is sufficient for the planned subgroup analyses (see power analysis in /scholar-design)
- Access pathway is realistic given project timeline

### Step 0c. IPUMS access note

IPUMS harmonizes many datasets above (ACS, CPS, GSS, international census, CPS-ASEC). Always check IPUMS first:
- `ipums.org` — IPUMS USA (ACS/Census), IPUMS CPS, IPUMS International
- `gss.norc.org` — GSS directly; or IPUMS MICS
- API access via `ipumsr` R package or `ipumspy` Python package

```r
library(ipumsr)
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("usa_00001.xml")
df  <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
```

### Step 0d. Auto-Fetch Open Data (EXECUTE — not just recommend)

**When the user specifies or you identify an "Immediate" access public data source from the directory above, DO NOT just produce code templates — actually download the data now.** This step converts `data-status: no-data` into `data-status: existing-data`.

Create `data/` directory and download:

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/clean
```

**Match the data source and execute the appropriate download:**

**After successful download:**
1. Confirm the file exists and report row count: `nrow(df)` / `len(df)`
2. Log the download to `data/raw/download-manifest.md`:
   ```
   | File | Source | Date fetched | N rows | Variables |
   |------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
   | acs-tract-IL-2022.rds | tidycensus ACS 5-year | 2026-03-03 | 15,420 | medinc, pop, pct_bach, pct_poverty |
   ```
3. **Update PROJECT STATE**: set `data-status: existing-data` and `Data File(s): data/raw/[filename]`
4. Proceed with all downstream skills in **DATA-AVAILABLE MODE** — no more `[CODE-TEMPLATE]` or `[PLACEHOLDER]`

**If the download fails — API key missing (MOST COMMON):**

Before falling back to CODE-TEMPLATE, **ask the user for the missing API key**. Most open data APIs offer free keys:

| Source | Env variable | Where to get a free key |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| ACS / Census / CPS (`tidycensus`) | `CENSUS_API_KEY` | https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html |
| FRED (`fredr`) | `FRED_API_KEY` | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html |
| ESS (`essurvey`) | ESS registered email | https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new |
| DHS (`rdhs`) | DHS registered email + project | https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm |
| FBI Crime Data Explorer | `FBI_API_KEY` | https://api.data.gov/signup/ |
| Semantic Scholar | `S2_API_KEY` | https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api (optional, for higher limits) |

Prompt the user:
```
To download [SOURCE] data, I need an API key.

You can get a free key here: [URL]

Please provide your API key, or I can proceed with code templates instead.
```

If the user provides a key:
1. Set it in the R environment: `Sys.setenv(CENSUS_API_KEY = "[key]")` or equivalent
2. Save it to `.Renviron` for future sessions: `cat('CENSUS_API_KEY=[key]\n', file = "~/.Renviron", append = TRUE)`
3. Retry the download
4. If successful → upgrade `data-status` to `existing-data`

**Sources that do NOT require API keys** (always attempt these first):
- World Bank (`WDI`) — no key needed
- NHANES (`nhanesA`) — no key needed
- GSS (`gssr`) — no key needed
- Google Trends (`gtrendsR`) — no key needed
- BLS (`blsAPI` v1) — no key needed (v2 optional key for higher limits)
- College Scorecard — direct CSV download, no key needed
- Opportunity Atlas — direct CSV download, no key needed
- GDELT — direct download, no key needed
- Direct URL datasets (GitHub, OSF, Dataverse) — no key needed
- OpenAlex (`openalexR`) — no key needed (use `mailto` for polite pool)
- Eurostat (`eurostat`) — no key needed
- WHO GHO API — no key needed
- Penn World Table — direct download, no key needed
- FAOSTAT (`FAOSTAT`) — no key needed
- Harvard Dataverse (`dataverse` / `pyDataverse`) — no key for public datasets
- Zenodo REST API — no key for public records
- Semantic Scholar API — no key needed (rate-limited; optional key for higher limits)
- Crossref API — no key needed (use `mailto` for polite pool)
- Afrobarometer — direct download after free registration
- IPUMS (`ipumsr`) — free registration required, then direct download
- UCR / NIBRS crime data — direct download from FBI Crime Data Explorer
- NASA SEDAC — free registration, direct download
- Data.gov — direct CSV/JSON downloads, no key needed

**Sources requiring free registration** (attempt after no-key sources):
- ESS (`essurvey`) — free registration at europeansocialsurvey.org
- OECD (`OECD`) — free API, no key but registration recommended
- DHS (`rdhs`) — free registration + approved project at dhsprogram.com
- WVS — free registration at worldvaluessurvey.org
- ISSP — free registration at GESIS
- Eurobarometer — free registration at GESIS
- Latinobarómetro — free registration at latinobarometro.org
- LIS / LWS — free registration at lisdatacenter.org
- UK Data Service — free registration (UK higher ed)
- Roper Center iPoll — institutional membership required

**If the download fails for other reasons** (network error, rate limit, package not installed):
- Log the specific error message
- If package missing: attempt `install.packages("[pkg]")` and retry once
- If network error: inform user and fall back to `[CODE-TEMPLATE]`
- Keep `data-status: no-data` and note the reason in PROJECT STATE

## WORKFLOW 1: Variable Dictionary and Measurement Plan

Produce a formal variable dictionary — the backbone of your Methods section and IRB application. Run after identifying the dataset (WORKFLOW 0) and confirming the design (/scholar-design).

### Step 1a. Variable dictionary table

For every variable in the analytic model, document:

| Role | Variable name | Construct | Operationalization | Source question / admin field | Type | Range / categories | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------|--------------------|-------|
| **Y** (Outcome) | `earnings_ln` | Annual labor market earnings | Log of annual earnings ($) | PSID Q_annual_earnings | Continuous | 0–∞ (log-transformed) | Top-coded at 99th pct |
| **X** (Key predictor) | `immigrant` | Immigrant status | Born outside US (1=yes) | ACS NATIVITY | Binary | 0/1 | — |
| **M** (Mediator) | `english_prof` | English language proficiency | 4-point self-report scale | CPS SPEAKENG | Ordinal | 1=not at all … 4=very well | — |
| **W** (Moderator) | `race_eth` | Race/ethnicity | Self-identified 5-category | ACS RACE + HISPAN | Categorical | White/Black/Hispanic/Asian/Other | ref = White |
| **C** (Control) | `educ_yrs` | Years of schooling | Recoded from education categories | ACS EDUC | Continuous | 0–20 | Midpoints used |
| **C** | `age` | Age in years | — | ACS AGE | Continuous | 25–64 | Working-age restriction |
| **C** | `female` | Female | Sex == female | ACS SEX | Binary | 0/1 | — |
| **FE / cluster** | `state` | State | State FIPS code | ACS STATEFIP | Categorical | 51 states + DC | For FE or clustering |

### Variable Dictionary Template

| Variable Name | Label | Type | Values/Range | Source Item | Coding Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `income_hh` | Household annual income | Continuous ($) | 0–999,999 | "Total household income last year" | Top-coded at $999,999; log-transform recommended |
| `educ_yrs` | Years of education | Continuous (years) | 0–25 | "Highest grade completed" | Recode GED=12; professional degree=20 |
| `race_eth` | Race/ethnicity (5 categories) | Categorical | 1=White NH, 2=Black NH, 3=Hispanic, 4=Asian NH, 5=Other | Combined from race + Hispanic origin | Standard Census categories |
| `employed` | Currently employed | Binary | 0=No, 1=Yes | "Did you work last week?" | Missing if not in labor force (code separately) |
| `missing_code` | — | — | NA / -9 / .d / .r | — | NA=system missing; -9=refused; .d=don't know; .r=refused |

**Scale direction convention**: Always code so higher values = more of the construct (e.g., 1=strongly disagree → 5=strongly agree). Reverse-code items before analysis.

**Variable naming convention**: `[concept]_[modifier]` (e.g., `income_hh`, `income_per_capita`, `educ_yrs`, `educ_degree`).

### Step 1b. Measurement validity checklist

For each key construct, verify:
- **Face validity**: Does the operationalization obviously measure the concept?
- **Content validity**: Does it cover all relevant aspects of the construct?
- **Construct validity**: Are established scales being used? Is there prior evidence of reliability (α, test-retest)?
- **Measurement equivalence**: Does the measure mean the same thing across the groups being compared (e.g., across racial groups, immigration cohorts)?

### Step 1c. Data blueprint summary

Produce a one-page data blueprint:

```
DATA BLUEPRINT
─────────────────────────────────
Research question: [RQ from Phase 0/1]
Dataset: [Name, year/wave, N]
Unit of analysis: [person / household / tract / ...]
Analytic sample: [population restriction + expected N]
Outcome (Y): [variable name + operationalization]
Key predictor (X): [variable name + operationalization]
Mediator(s) (M): [if applicable]
Moderator(s) (W): [if applicable]
Controls: [list]
Design: [cross-sectional / panel / DiD / RD / IV / matching]
Fixed effects / clusters: [unit + SE clustering level]
Weights: [survey weight variable name, if applicable]
Missing data strategy: [listwise / MI — based on /scholar-eda]
```

---

## WORKFLOW 2: Survey Instrument Design

### Step 1: Define Measurement Goals

For each construct, specify:
- **Conceptual definition**: What is the construct theoretically?
- **Operational definition**: What observable behavior/attitude/characteristic measures it?
- **Measurement level**: Nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
- **Reference period**: "In the past 12 months," "currently," "ever"

### Step 2: Question Construction

**Question types and when to use:**

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Single-item Likert | Attitudes with established scales | "Strongly agree → Strongly disagree" |
| Multi-item scale | Latent constructs (trust, identity) | Average of 5 items; report α |
| Open-ended | Unexpected responses, sensitive topics | "In your own words, describe…" |
| Numeric entry | Factual, bounded | "How many years have you lived in the US?" |
| Matrix / grid | Battery of related items | Multiple rows, shared response scale |
| Ranking | Relative preference | "Rank the following from most to least…" |
| Filtered / branching | Subpopulation follow-ups | "If yes → [follow-up]" |

**Question wording rules:**
- One concept per question (no double-barreled: "Do you trust neighbors *and* local government?")
- Avoid negations
- 8th-grade reading level
- Offer "Don't know" / "Prefer not to answer" where appropriate
- Consistent response direction (higher = more of the construct)
- Match scale length to construct precision needed (5-pt standard; 7-pt for fine-grained attitudes)

**Established scales to use** (cite if using):
- Social trust: Rosenberg Trust Scale; GSS trust items
- Subjective SES: MacArthur Ladder (1–10)
- Discrimination: Everyday Discrimination Scale (Williams et al. 1997)
- Mental health: PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety)
- Political attitudes: ANES scales
- Immigrant identity: MEIM-R (Phinney & Ong 2007)
- Social network: Burt (1984) name generator + name interpreter

See [references/survey-design.md](references/survey-design.md) for full item batteries.

### Step 3: Survey Organization

**Recommended order:**
1. Introduction screen (purpose, consent, confidentiality)
2. Screener questions (eligibility)
3. Salient but non-threatening items first
4. Sensitive items (income, discrimination, illegal behavior) later
5. Sociodemographics last
6. Debriefing / thank-you screen

**Sample size for surveys:**

| Goal | Rule of thumb | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Descriptive estimates (proportions) | N ≥ 400 for ±5% margin (95% CI) | N ≥ 1,000 for subgroup comparisons |
| Regression with 10 predictors | N ≥ 500 for OLS (Cohen's rule: 50 + 8k) | N ≥ 1,000 for logistic |
| Experimental contrast (d = 0.3, 80% power) | N ≥ 352 per arm | Use `pwr::pwr.t.test()` |
| Conjoint / AMCE (1% precision) | N ≥ 1,000, 3–5 tasks | More profiles = better precision |
| Multilevel (ICC = 0.10, L2 effects) | N ≥ 30 groups × 30 within | Use `pwr2ppl` or `simr` |

**Online panel quality tiers:**

| Tier | Panel | Quality | Cost | Best for |
|------|-------|---------|------|---------|
| Probability-based | IPSOS KnowledgePanel, Amerispeak | Highest | $$$ | Top-tier publication; nationally representative |
| High-quality opt-in | Prolific Academic | High | $$ | Academic research; attention checks built-in |
| MTurk | MTurk (via CloudResearch) | Medium | $ | Pilot testing; not recommended for main analysis |
| Convenience | Qualtrics panel, Lucid | Variable | $–$$ | Pretest; not representative |

**Data quality checks:**
- Completion time < ⅓ median → flag inattentive
- Straight-lining on Likert batteries
- Instructed response item failures (attention checks)
- Open-ended gibberish / copy-paste
- IP duplicates

### Step 4: Pilot and Cognitive Testing

1. Expert review (2–3 colleagues; face validity)
2. Cognitive interviewing (5–10 respondents; 4-probe protocol — see survey-design.md)
3. Pilot survey (N = 20–50; check distributions, timing, drop-off)
4. Psychometric checks: CFA for multi-item scales; remove items loading < 0.4

### Step 5: Fielding and Documentation

- Platform: Qualtrics (complex routing) > Prolific (probability-based recruitment) > REDCap (clinical/HIPAA)
- AAPOR response rate documentation (RR1–RR6) required in Methods
- Non-response analysis: compare respondents to non-respondents or population benchmarks

### Step 6: Experimental Survey Modules

#### Step 6a: Vignette / Factorial Survey Experiment

A factorial survey presents randomized descriptions (vignettes) of hypothetical persons or situations and asks respondents to evaluate them. Used to measure preferences, discrimination, or decision-making while controlling for confounds.

**Design:**
- 2–5 dimensions varied; 2–4 levels per dimension → full or fractional factorial design
- Each respondent rates 3–8 vignettes (avoid fatigue)
- Analyze with OLS clustered by respondent (AMCE: Average Marginal Component Effect)

**Vignette template:**
```
[Respondent instructions]:
"Below is a description of a job applicant. Please read carefully and rate
how likely you would be to invite them for an interview."

Job applicant profile:
  Name:            [RANDOMIZED: Michael Johnson / DeShawn Jackson / José García]
  Education:       [RANDOMIZED: High school diploma / Bachelor's degree / Master's degree]
  Years of exp.:   [RANDOMIZED: 2 years / 5 years / 10 years]
  Criminal record: [RANDOMIZED: None / Misdemeanor / Felony]

"How likely would you be to invite this applicant for an interview?"
  (1) Very unlikely — (2) Unlikely — (3) Neutral — (4) Likely — (5) Very likely
```

**Analysis (R):**
```r
library(cregg)
# Estimate AMCEs
amce_results <- cj(data = df, formula = outcome ~ name + education + experience + criminal,
                   id = ~respondent_id)
plot(amce_results) + theme_Publication()

# Subgroup AMCEs
amce_sub <- cj(df, outcome ~ name + education, id = ~respondent_id,
               by = ~respondent_race)
```

**Report:** "We used a factorial survey experiment with [N] vignettes and [K] randomized dimensions. Average marginal component effects (AMCEs; Hainmueller, Hopkins & Yamamoto 2014) were estimated using OLS with standard errors clustered by respondent."

#### Step 6b: List Experiment (Sensitive Item Measurement)

List experiments allow respondents to reveal sensitive attitudes (racism, illegal behavior, stigmatized conditions) without directly endorsing them — protecting against social desirability bias.

**Design (split-half):**
- Control group: 3 innocuous items → "How many of the following have you done in the past year?"
- Treatment group: same 3 items + 1 sensitive item
- Difference in means = % endorsing sensitive item

**Template:**
```
[Control condition]:
"Below is a list of things some people have done. Please tell us
HOW MANY you have done in the past year — not which ones, just how many."
  1. Watched a movie at home
  2. Donated to a charity
  3. Attended a religious service
  [Answer: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3]

[Treatment condition — adds sensitive item]:
  1. Watched a movie at home
  2. Donated to a charity
  3. Attended a religious service
  4. [Sensitive: e.g., "Used marijuana" / "Supported restricting immigration"]
  [Answer: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4]
```

**Analysis (R):**
```r
library(list)
lexp <- ict.test(df$count, df$treatment, J = 3, gms = TRUE)
summary(lexp)
# Reports: estimated prevalence + SE + 95% CI for sensitive item
```

**Sample size:** N ≥ 500 per arm (N ≥ 1,000 total) for ±5% precision. List experiments are statistically inefficient — plan for larger samples than direct questions would require.

## WORKFLOW 3: Qualitative Interview Protocol

### Step 1: Protocol Architecture

A qualitative interview guide has three parts:
1. **Preamble**: introduce yourself, state purpose, obtain consent, explain recording
2. **Core guide**: 8–15 open-ended questions organized thematically (3–5 themes)
3. **Closing**: ask for what was missed; offer referrals if sensitive topics were discussed

**Sampling strategy:**

| Strategy | Purpose | Typical N |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Maximum variation | Capture full range of relevant variation | 20–40 |
| Homogeneous | Depth within one type | 15–25 |
| Theoretical (grounded theory) | Continue until conceptual saturation | 15–30 |
| Critical case | Test theory on hardest case | 5–15 |
| Snowball | Hard-to-reach populations | Varies |

Saturation typically occurs at N = 15–25 for a single population; more for comparative multi-group designs.

### Step 2: Question Sequence

See [references/interview-protocols.md](references/interview-protocols.md) for full template. Core structure:

1. Rapport opener (biographical, low-stakes)
2. Grand tour question (typical day / typical encounter with X)
3. Thematic questions (2–4 per theme) with explicit probes
4. Contrast / comparison questions
5. Meaning / interpretation questions
6. Closing ("What haven't I asked?")

**Probing types:** elaboration / clarification / example / contrast / emotional (use sparingly)

### Step 3: Sensitive Topics Protocol

- State upfront which topics will be covered; allow opt-out before starting
- Use distancing language: "Some people I've talked with say… What's your experience?"
- Never press for more detail than offered
- Prepare referral resources (hotlines, social services) before fieldwork
- Debrief at close: "We covered some difficult topics — how are you feeling?"

### Step 4: Focus Groups (alternative format)

Use when group interaction is the phenomenon of interest (e.g., deliberation, norm formation, collective sense-making). **Not** a substitute for in-depth interviews when individual experience is the target.

- Group size: 5–8 participants (too small → insufficient interaction; too large → some dominated)
- Number of groups: 3–6 per subgroup; stop when theoretical saturation is reached
- Facilitator role: introduce topics, manage dominant voices, ensure quieter participants contribute
- Co-facilitator: takes notes on nonverbal dynamics while facilitator runs discussion
- Analyze turn-taking patterns alongside content

### Step 5: Online / Video Interviews

- Zoom / Teams: adequate for most semi-structured interviews; less rapport than in-person
- Provide tech support beforehand; confirm platform access and audio/video
- Record with consent (built-in recording; confirm jurisdiction-specific legality)
- Background and setting: note if participant is in private vs. semi-public space
- Transcription: Otter.ai / Whisper for automatic draft; always human-review for accuracy

### Step 6: Multilingual Fieldwork

- Translate instrument using forward-backward procedure (translate → back-translate → reconcile)
- Use bilingual interviewers; never rely solely on respondent to translate
- Conduct interviews in respondent's preferred language; document language used
- Analysis: code from transcript in original language; translate selected quotes for publication
- Report language of interview and translation procedure in Methods

## WORKFLOW 4: Administrative and Secondary Data

> Record-linkage / spatial-join code authored here, when executed, is IN SCOPE for the Pre-Execution Review Duty (above).

### Step 1: Data Access Strategy

| Access type | Route | Timeline |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Public use micro-data (ACS, CPS, GSS) | IPUMS, Census, ICPSR — register and download | Immediate |
| Restricted federal data (NLSY restricted, HRS geocoded) | ICPSR DUA | 2–4 weeks |
| FSRDC-linked data (SSA + IRS + survey) | FSRDC application (PI must be Census employee or external researcher) | 12–24 months |
| State administrative records (Medicaid, court, school) | State agency MOU + institutional DUA + IRB | 6–18 months |
| Private / commercial data (credit, social media, employer) | Data sharing agreement; often requires fee or in-kind contribution | Varies |

### Step 2: Data Documentation Review

Before analysis, document for every source:
- Survey instrument or administrative codebook / data dictionary
- Variable names, labels, value codes (distinguish "don't know" / "refused" / "not applicable")
- Sampling design: stratification, clustering, probability weights
- Panel structure (if longitudinal): wave IDs, response rates, attrition rates by wave
- Geographic identifiers and level of geography available (state / PUMA / tract)
- Top-coding and suppression rules (especially in restricted-use files)

### Step 3: Data Linkage

When merging two or more data sources:
- Document matching variables (name, SSN, address, date of birth, geographic ID)
- Report match rate and characterize match vs. non-match cases (selective linkage is a validity threat)
- **Probabilistic record linkage** (when exact matching fails):

```r
library(fastLink)
matches <- fastLink(
  dfA = df1, dfB = df2,
  varnames = c("fname", "lname", "dob", "zip"),
  stringdist.match = c("fname", "lname"),
  numeric.match = "zip",
  threshold.match = 0.85
)
matched <- getMatches(dfA = df1, dfB = df2, fl.out = matches)
```

- Report concordance rates for key variables across sources

### Step 4: Geographic / Spatial Data

```r
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)

# Download Census tract-level ACS variables
tracts <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract", state = "IL", county = "Cook",
  variables = c(medinc = "B19013_001", pct_black = "B03002_004"),
  year = 2022, geometry = TRUE
)

# TIGER/Line shapefiles
library(tigris)
counties_sf <- counties(state = "IL", cb = TRUE, year = 2022)

# Join survey / administrative data to geographic units
df_spatial <- df %>% left_join(tracts, by = c("tract_fips" = "GEOID"))
```

For historical geographic data: IPUMS NHGIS provides Census tract boundaries and variables for every decade since 1790.

## WORKFLOW 5: IRB and Research Ethics

### Step 1: Determine IRB Level

**Exempt categories** (45 CFR 46.104 — post-2018 Common Rule):

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Normal educational practices in established educational settings | Classroom curriculum study |
| 2 | Anonymous surveys / interviews / observations (no sensitive topics; no identifiers) | Online survey on public attitudes |
| 2 (sensitive) | Survey / interview on sensitive topics but subjects are 18+ and disclosure would not harm them | Discrimination survey with adult workers |
| 3 | Benign behavioral interventions with verbal consent | Random assignment to information treatments |
| 4 | Secondary analysis of existing identifiable data if investigator cannot identify subjects | Analysis of de-identified medical records |
| 5 | Federal research on public benefit programs | Survey of SNAP recipients |
| 6 | Taste / food quality evaluation studies | Food preference study |
| 7 | Storage / maintenance of identifiable data for future secondary use | Biospecimen repository |
| 8 | Broad consent research using identifiable biospecimens | Genetic research |

**Expedited review** (minimal risk + falls into expedited categories): most online surveys with adults, in-depth interviews without vulnerable populations, secondary analysis of identifiable data with DUA.

**Full board review**: vulnerable populations (minors, prisoners, pregnant women); deception studies; research in international settings with different norms; studies involving more than minimal risk.

### Step 2: Waiver of Consent

A waiver of written (or all) consent may be granted when:
- The research involves no more than minimal risk
- Waiver will not adversely affect subjects' rights and welfare
- Research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver
- When appropriate, subjects will be provided pertinent information afterward

Online surveys with anonymous responses typically qualify for waiver of documented consent (checkbox consent screen suffices).

### Step 3: IRB Application Components

- Research protocol: purpose, procedures, population, timeline
- Consent form / script: lay language; institutional template required
- Survey instrument or interview guide: submit with application
- Recruitment materials: scripts, flyers, emails, social media posts
- Data security plan: storage, encryption, access controls, destruction timeline
- CITI training certificates: Human Subjects Research (social-behavioral track)
- Conflict of interest disclosure

### Step 4: Data Security Standards

- Remove direct identifiers (name, address, SSN, email) → replace with study IDs
- Store PII separately from research data in encrypted folder
- Use institutional storage for identified data (not personal Google Drive / Dropbox)
- Encrypt files at rest (VeraCrypt, BitLocker) and in transit (SFTP, not FTP)
- Specify retention period in IRB protocol (standard: 3 years post-publication; NIH: 7 years)

## WORKFLOW 6: Data Management Pipeline

> Cleaning/construction code authored here is IN SCOPE for the Pre-Execution Review Duty (above): draft to `scripts/` first, review, gate, then execute the reviewed file.

### Step 1: Directory Structure

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p data/{raw,clean,analysis,codebooks} \
         docs/{irb,instruments,protocols} \
         scripts \
         "${OUTPUT_ROOT}"/{tables,figures}

# Protect raw data from accidental modification
chmod -w data/raw/
```

Maintain strict separation:
```
project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/          ← NEVER modify; treat as read-only
│   ├── clean/        ← after cleaning; reproducible from raw
│   ├── analysis/     ← analytic sample used in paper
│   └── codebooks/    ← variable documentation
├── scripts/
│   ├── 01_download.R     (or .do)
│   ├── 02_clean.R
│   ├── 03_eda.R
│   ├── 04_main_models.R
│   ├── 05_robustness.R
│   └── 06_figures.R
├── output/[slug]/
│   ├── tables/
│   └── figures/
└── docs/
    ├── codebook.md
    ├── data_cleaning_log.md
    └── pre_analysis_plan.md
```

### Step 2: Git Version Control for Code

```bash
git init
git add scripts/ docs/ output/[slug]/
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# .gitignore — keep sensitive data out of git
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Raw and identified data — never commit
data/raw/
data/clean/*.rds
data/clean/*.dta
data/analysis/

# Credentials and keys
.Renviron
.env
*.key

# OS and editor clutter
.DS_Store
*.Rproj.user/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
EOF
```

**Best practice:** Commit scripts and outputs (tables, figures) to git; never commit raw data or identified data files. Use `.Renviron` or `.env` for API keys.

### Step 3: Codebook

Create a codebook with variable-level documentation:

| var_name | var_label | type | values | missing_codes | source | notes |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|--------------|--------|-------|
| id | Unique respondent ID | string | — | — | Generated | Never use for analysis |
| educ_yrs | Years of education | integer | 0–25 | NA | Q14; recoded | midpoints: HS=12, BA=16 |
| income_1k | Annual HH income ($1000s) | numeric | 0–250 | NA | Q22 | top-coded at $250K |

**R codebook tools:**
```r
library(codebook); library(labelled)
var_label(df$educ_yrs) <- "Years of formal education completed"
val_labels(df$educ_cat) <- c("Less than HS" = 1, "HS" = 2, "Some college" = 3, "BA" = 4, "Grad" = 5)
codebook(df)  # generates HTML codebook
```

See [references/data-management.md](references/data-management.md) for R and Stata cleaning pipeline templates.

### Step 4: Data Sharing Plan (DMP)

Required for NSF/NIH grants and increasingly expected at Nature journals and Demography.

**DMP template:**

```
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN — [Project Title]
PI: [Name] | Institution: [Name] | Date: [Date]

1. DATA TYPES AND SOURCES
   [Describe: survey data / administrative records / observational / experimental;
    estimated file sizes; formats (RDS, CSV, DTA, shapefiles)]

2. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE
   Collection method: [Qualtrics / IPUMS download / administrative transfer]
   Storage: [Institutional server + encrypted external backup]
   Backup frequency: [Daily automated backup; monthly off-site]
   Retention period: [3 years post-publication / 7 years (NIH) / permanent (if public value)]

3. DATA SHARING AND ACCESS
   Sharing plan: [Full public release / Restricted access / Unable to share (reason)]
   Repository: [Harvard Dataverse / ICPSR / Zenodo / OSF]
   Timeline: [Upon publication / within 12 months of completion]
   Format: [CSV + codebook + README (non-proprietary preferred)]
   Access restrictions: [None / IRB-approved researchers only / licensed use]

4. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
   Identifiers: [Removed per IRB protocol; study IDs only in shared files]
   Disclosure risk: [Suppression rules applied; k-anonymity ≥ 5 for geographic vars]
   Consent: [Participants consented to data sharing / anonymous; no consent needed]

5. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
   PI: [responsible for compliance, repository deposit]
   Co-I/RA: [responsible for data preparation and documentation]
```

### Step 5: Naming Conventions and Version Control

**Variables:** lowercase, underscores, no special characters
- Suffixes: `_cat` (categorical), `_bin` (binary), `_ln` (log), `_std` (standardized), `_w` (winsorized)
- Wave prefixes: `w1_`, `w2_` for panel data

**Files:** lowercase with hyphens; include date for versioned files
- `gss-2022-clean.rds`, `analysis-data-2024-01-15.rds`

**Scripts:** numbered for execution order (see directory structure above)

## WORKFLOW 7: Web Scraping and Digital Data Collection

Use when primary data must be collected from websites, social media platforms, news archives, or public APIs. Always attempt API-first; fall back to HTML scraping only when no API exists.

> Scraper code authored here is IN SCOPE for the Pre-Execution Review Duty (above): save to `scripts/scraping/NN-*` first, review, gate, THEN run against live targets.

### Step 1: Ethical and Legal Framework

Before any scraping, review:

| Check | Requirement | Action if violated |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `robots.txt` | Check `https://site.com/robots.txt`; respect `Disallow` paths | Do not scrape disallowed paths |
| Terms of Service | Read ToS; many platforms explicitly prohibit scraping | Use official API or request data license |
| Rate limits | Impose delays ≥ 1–3 sec between requests | Use `polite` (R) or `time.sleep()` (Python) |
| CFAA | U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act — public data generally protected (*hiQ v. LinkedIn* 2022) | Document that data was publicly accessible without authentication |
| GDPR / privacy | EU personal data requires legal basis for collection | Anonymize or aggregate; consult IRB |
| IRB | Public posts generally exempt (Category 4); semi-public or identifiable data may require expedited review | Document IRB determination before collection |

**Polite scraping principles:**
- Identify your bot with an academic user-agent: `"Research bot — [Name], [Institution] ([email])"`
- Randomize delays: `Sys.sleep(runif(1, 1, 3))` / `time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))`
- Cache responses to avoid re-requesting the same pages
- Scrape during off-peak hours to minimize server load

### Web Scraping: Legal and Ethical Checklist

Before scraping, verify:
- [ ] **Terms of Service**: Does the website/platform prohibit scraping? (Twitter/X: Academic API discontinued Jan 2025, Pro tier $5K/mo required for full-archive; Reddit: check API terms; LinkedIn: scraping prohibited)
- [ ] **robots.txt**: Check `[domain]/robots.txt` for crawl restrictions
- [ ] **IRB review**: Does your institution consider public social media data as human subjects research? (Many do — check with your IRB)
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Implement polite crawling (≥1 second between requests; respect rate limits)
- [ ] **Data storage**: Comply with GDPR if collecting EU user data (right to be forgotten, data minimization)
- [ ] **Identifiability**: Can users be identified from scraped content? If yes, de-identify before analysis
- [ ] **Consent**: Is there a reasonable expectation of privacy? (public tweets: generally no; private Facebook groups: yes)

**Platform-specific guidance**:
| Platform | Access Method | Rate Limit | Key Restriction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Twitter/X | X API v2 (Basic/Pro/Enterprise tiers; Academic Research track discontinued Jan 2025) | Varies by tier (Basic: 10K reads/mo free; Pro: 1M reads/mo $5K/mo) | Must not share raw tweet text; share IDs only; historical full-archive requires Pro+ |
| Reddit | Reddit API (register app) | 60 req/min (OAuth) | Respect subreddit rules; user consent not required for public posts |
| News sites | Web scraping + newspaper3k | Varies (check robots.txt) | Fair use for research; do not republish full text |
| Congressional Record | congress.gov API | No strict limit | Public domain; no restrictions |

---

### Step 2: API-First Strategy

Always prefer an official API over HTML scraping. Prioritize by data type:

**Social media:**

| Platform | API / Access route | Package | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|---------|-------|
| Twitter / X | X API v2 (Basic: free 10K reads/mo; Pro: $5K/mo 1M reads; Enterprise: custom; Academic Research track discontinued Jan 2025) | `academictwitteR` (R, limited to existing tokens), `tweepy` (Py) | Pro+ required for full-archive search; Basic tier severely rate-limited; consider Bluesky AT Protocol as alternative |
| Reddit | Reddit API v2 + PRAW | `RedditExtractoR` (R), `praw` (Py) | Free; rate limits enforced; Pushshift archive restricted as of 2023 |
| Facebook / Instagram | Meta Content Library (replaces CrowdTangle) | `contentid` + Meta API | Application required; access for academic researchers |
| TikTok | TikTok Research API | REST + Python SDK | Application required; limited to public content |
| YouTube | YouTube Data API v3 | `tuber` (R), `google-api-python-client` (Py) | Free quota: 10,000 units/day |

**News and text:**

| Source | API / Access | Package | Notes |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| GDELT | BigQuery or direct download | `Rgdelt` (R), pandas direct | Free; global news events + tone + location + URLs |
| MediaCloud | mediacloud.org | `mediacloud` (Py) | Story-level coverage and framing; requires registration |
| NewsAPI | newsapi.org | REST | Free tier: 1 month history; developer tier: $449/mo |
| Internet Archive | CDX API + Wayback Machine | `wayback` (R), requests CDX | Full historical web; excellent for longitudinal designs |

**Government and social science APIs:**

```r
# Census API via tidycensus (see WORKFLOW 4)
# BLS API
library(blsAPI)
bls_data <- blsAPI(list(seriesid = "LNS14000000", startyear = "2010", endyear = "2023"))

# World Bank via WDI
library(WDI)
wdi <- WDI(country = c("US", "MX", "CA"), indicator = "NY.GDP.MKTP.CD",
           start = 2000, end = 2022)

# FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
library(fredr)
fredr_set_key(Sys.getenv("FRED_API_KEY"))
unemp <- fredr(series_id = "UNRATE", observation_start = as.Date("2000-01-01"))
```

---

### Step 3: Static HTML Scraping — R (`rvest` + `polite`)

Use for sites with HTML-rendered content (no JavaScript required):

```r
library(rvest)
library(polite)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 1: Establish a polite session (checks robots.txt + sets delays)
session <- bow(
  url        = "https://example.com/articles",
  user_agent = "Academic research bot (set your email in SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_EMAIL)",
  delay      = 2  # minimum seconds between requests
)

# Step 2: Scrape a single page
page <- scrape(session)

# Step 3: Extract elements via CSS selectors (use browser DevTools to find selectors)
titles <- page %>% html_nodes("h2.article-title") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
links  <- page %>% html_nodes("a.article-link")   %>% html_attr("href")
dates  <- page %>% html_nodes("span.pub-date")     %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)

df_page <- tibble(title = titles, url = links, date = dates)

# Step 4: Multi-page scraping (paginated)
base_url <- "https://example.com/articles?page="
results  <- map_dfr(1:20, function(p) {
  nod(session, paste0(base_url, p)) %>%  # update URL, keep polite session
    scrape() %>%
    {tibble(
      title = html_nodes(., "h2.article-title") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE),
      url   = html_nodes(., "a.article-link")   %>% html_attr("href"),
      date  = html_nodes(., "span.pub-date")     %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
    )}
}, .progress = TRUE)

# Step 5: Save raw data immediately
saveRDS(results, "data/raw/scraped-articles-raw.rds")
write_csv(results, "data/raw/scraped-articles-raw.csv")
message("Scraped N = ", nrow(results), " articles")
```

**Selector identification:** In Chrome/Firefox, right-click an element → Inspect → right-click in DevTools → Copy → Copy selector. Prefer class-based selectors (`.article-title`) over position-based (`div > p:nth-child(3)`).

---

### Step 4: Static HTML Scraping — Python (`requests` + `BeautifulSoup`)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import time, random, json
from pathlib import Path

HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Academic research bot (set your email in SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_EMAIL)"
}

session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update(HEADERS)

def scrape_page(url: str, delay: tuple = (1.0, 3.0)) -> BeautifulSoup:
    """Politely fetch and parse a single page."""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(*delay))
    resp = session.get(url, timeout=15)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return BeautifulSoup(resp.text, "html.parser")

def parse_article(soup: BeautifulSoup) -> dict:
    return {
        "title": soup.select_one("h2.article-title").get_text(strip=True),
        "date":  soup.select_one("span.pub-date").get_text(strip=True),
        "body":  " ".join(p.get_text(strip=True)
                          for p in soup.select("div.article-body p"))
    }

# Multi-page collection
records = []
for page_num in range(1, 21):
    soup = scrape_page(f"https://example.com/articles?page={page_num}")
    for card in soup.select("div.article-card"):
        records.append({
            "title": card.select_one("h2").get_text(strip=True),
            "url":   card.select_one("a")["href"],
            "date":  card.select_one("span.date").get_text(strip=True)
        })
    print(f"Page {page_num}: {len(records)} articles so far")

df = pd.DataFrame(records)
Path("data/raw").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
df.to_csv("data/raw/scraped-articles-raw.csv", index=False)
print(f"Saved {len(df)} articles")
```

---

### Step 5: Dynamic / JavaScript-Rendered Pages

For single-page applications (React, Vue) or pages that load content via XHR after initial HTML load:

**R — `chromote` (recommended; headless Chrome):**

```r
library(chromote)
library(rvest)

b <- ChromoteSession$new()

# Navigate and wait for content
b$Page$navigate("https://example.com/dynamic-page")
b$Page$loadEventFired()          # wait for full page load
Sys.sleep(2)                     # extra wait for JS rendering

# Extract rendered HTML
html <- b$Runtime$evaluate("document.documentElement.outerHTML")$result$value
page <- read_html(html)
b$close()

# Parse as usual with rvest
titles <- page %>% html_nodes("h2.article-title") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
```

**Python — `playwright` (recommended over selenium):**

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import time

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page    = browser.new_page()

    # Set academic user-agent
    page.set_extra_http_headers({
        "User-Agent": "Academic research bot — [Your Name], [Your University]"
    })

    page.goto("https://example.com/dynamic-page")
    page.wait_for_selector("div.article-list")   # wait for target element
    time.sleep(1)

    # Interact if needed (e.g., click "Load more")
    while page.locator("button.load-more").count() > 0:
        page.locator("button.load-more").click()
        page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")
        time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 2))

    html = page.content()
    browser.close()

soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
```

**Install:** `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium` / `install.packages("chromote")`

---

### Step 6: Social Media Data Collection

#### Twitter / X (X API v2)

> **Note (updated 2026):** The Academic Research track was discontinued in January 2025. The code below still works with X API v2 Bearer tokens, but full-archive search now requires a Pro ($5K/mo) or Enterprise tier. The free Basic tier allows only 10K tweet reads/month. For new social media research projects, consider Bluesky (AT Protocol, free firehose access) or Meta Content Library as alternatives.

```r
library(academictwitteR)

# Authenticate (store bearer token in .Renviron as TWITTER_BEARER)
set_bearer()

# Full-archive search (Academic access required)
tweets <- get_all_tweets(
  query    = '"redlining" lang:en -is:retweet',
  start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_tweets   = "2023-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  n        = 50000,
  data_path = "data/raw/tweets/"
)

# Bind collected data
df_tweets <- bind_tweets(data_path = "data/raw/tweets/", output_format = "tidy")
```

```python
# Python — tweepy v4
import tweepy, json, os

client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token=os.environ["TWITTER_BEARER"], wait_on_rate_limit=True)

paginator = tweepy.Paginator(
    client.search_all_tweets,
    query         = '"redlining" lang:en -is:retweet',
    tweet_fields  = ["created_at", "author_id", "text", "public_metrics", "geo"],
    start_time    = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_time      = "2023-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    max_results   = 500
)

tweets = [t for page in paginator for t in page.data or []]
with open("data/raw/tweets.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for t in tweets:
        f.write(json.dumps(t.data) + "\n")
print(f"Collected {len(tweets)} tweets")
```

#### Reddit (PRAW)

```python
import praw, pandas as pd, os

reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id     = os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret = os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    user_agent    = "Academic research — [Your Name], [Your University]"
)

# Collect posts from subreddits
subreddits = ["sociology", "urbanplanning", "firsttimehomebuyer"]
records = []
for sub_name in subreddits:
    sub = reddit.subreddit(sub_name)
    for post in sub.search("redlining", limit=500, time_filter="year"):
        records.append({
            "id": post.id, "subreddit": sub_name,
            "title": post.title, "selftext": post.selftext,
            "score": post.score, "num_comments": post.num_comments,
            "created_utc": post.created_utc, "url": post.url
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(records)
df.to_parquet("data/raw/reddit-posts.parquet", index=False)
```

### Step 7: Large-Scale Text and News Sources

**GDELT (global news events):**

```r
library(Rgdelt)
# Download event data for specific countries/actors
events <- gdelt_data(
  start_date = "2020-01-01", end_date = "2023-12-31",
  type = "events", country = "US"
)
# Or query via BigQuery for full dataset (free 1TB/month)
```

**Internet Archive Wayback Machine (longitudinal web):**

```python
import requests, pandas as pd

def wayback_cdx(url: str, from_date: str, to_date: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Get all archived snapshots of a URL between two dates."""
    cdx_url = (
        f"http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url={url}&output=json"
        f"&from={from_date}&to={to_date}&fl=timestamp,statuscode,original"
        f"&filter=statuscode:200&collapse=timestamp:6"  # one per month
    )
    resp = requests.get(cdx_url, timeout=30)
    rows = resp.json()[1:]  # skip header
    return pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=["timestamp", "statuscode", "url"])

snaps = wayback_cdx("example.com/policy-page", "20200101", "20231231")
# Retrieve archived HTML for each snapshot
for _, row in snaps.iterrows():
    archive_url = f"https://web.archive.org/web/{row.timestamp}/{row.url}"
    # ... scrape archive_url with requests + BeautifulSoup
```

---

### Step 8: Storage, Provenance, and Pipeline

**Always record metadata alongside scraped content:**

```r
# R: store with provenance metadata
df_raw <- df_raw %>%
  mutate(
    scraped_at = Sys.time(),
    source_url  = "https://example.com",
    scraper_version = "v1.0"
  )
saveRDS(df_raw, paste0("data/raw/scraped-", Sys.Date(), ".rds"))
```

```python
# Python: use DuckDB for large structured collections (faster than SQLite for analytics)
import duckdb, pandas as pd

con = duckdb.connect("data/raw/scraped.duckdb")
con.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS articles (
        id          VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
        url         VARCHAR,
        title       VARCHAR,
        date        DATE,
        body        TEXT,
        scraped_at  TIMESTAMP,
        source      VARCHAR
    )
""")
# Insert records in batch
con.executemany(
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO articles VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
    df[["id","url","title","date","body","scraped_at","source"]].values.tolist()
)
con.close()
```

**Parquet for large text corpora:**

```python
import pandas as pd
# Write in compressed Parquet partitioned by year
df.to_parquet("data/raw/news-corpus/", partition_cols=["year"], index=False)
# Read back a single year
df_2022 = pd.read_parquet("data/raw/news-corpus/year=2022/")
```

**Web scraping directory extension:**

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw/html_cache    # cached HTML pages
mkdir -p data/raw/api_responses # raw API JSON
mkdir -p scripts/scraping       # scraper scripts
echo "data/raw/html_cache/" >> .gitignore
echo "data/raw/api_responses/" >> .gitignore
```

**Scraping log template** (save as `docs/scraping-log.md`):

```
SCRAPING LOG
─────────────────────────────────────
Target site:       [URL]
Date range:        [start] to [end]
Script:            scripts/scraping/01_scrape.py
robots.txt status: Complied / No restrictions
ToS reviewed:      Yes / No — [notes]
IRB determination: [Exempt Cat. 4 / Expedited / Full]
Rate limiting:     [X] sec delay; randomized ± [Y] sec
Total records:     [N]
Raw files:         data/raw/[filename].parquet / .rds
Scrape timestamp:  [datetime]
Notes:             [any errors, blocks, or partial coverage]
─────────────────────────────────────
```

**For downstream text analysis:** hand off to `/scholar-compute` MODULE 1 (NLP: STM, BERT, LLM annotation) after cleaning.

See [references/web-scraping.md](references/web-scraping.md) for extended code examples, CSS selector guide, API authentication patterns, rate-limit handling, and error recovery.

## Save Output

After completing all relevant workflows, save a data plan document using the Write tool.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [values] with actuals before running
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# BASE pattern: ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/data/scholar-data-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
# Split into directory and stem for the gate script:
OUTDIR="$(dirname "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/data/scholar-data-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/data/scholar-data-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file. The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).

**Filename:** `scholar-data-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

**Contents:**

```markdown
# Data Plan: [topic]
*Generated by /scholar-data on [YYYY-MM-DD]*

## Data Blueprint
[Fill from WORKFLOW 1 Step 1c: dataset, unit, N, Y, X, M, W, controls, design]

## Variable Dictionary
[Full table from WORKFLOW 1 Step 1a]

## Data Access Plan
[Dataset name + access route + estimated timeline]

## Survey / Interview / Instrument Notes
[If new data collection: platform, panel, sample size rationale, cognitive testing plan]

## IRB Plan
[Determination: exempt / expedited / full; waiver of consent: yes/no; data security approach]

## Data Management Plan Summary
[Directory structure, git plan, codebook location, DMP repository]

## File Inventory
data/raw/           ← [source files]
data/clean/         ← [cleaned dataset: name.rds / .dta]
data/analysis/      ← [analytic sample: name.rds]
data/codebooks/     ← codebook.md
docs/               ← irb/, instruments/, protocols/
```

Confirm saved file path to user after Write completes.

**Close Process Log:**

Run the following to finalize the process log:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-data"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t "${OUTPUT_ROOT}"/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
cat >> "$LOG_FILE" << LOGFOOTER

## Output Files
[list each output file path as a bullet]

## Summary
- **Steps completed**: [N completed]/[N total]
- **Files produced**: [count]
- **Errors**: [count, or 0]
- **Time finished**: $(date +%H:%M:%S)
LOGFOOTER
echo "Process log saved to $LOG_FILE"
```
