# descriptives-coverage-check.sh — Phase 8 / Phase 13 coverage gate.
#
# Audit 2026-05-06 (cfps-platform-trust-asr-auto): the original
# 03-descriptives-and-missingness.R built `tables/table1-descriptives.csv`
# from a HARDCODED 14-variable subset rather than from the live
# spec-registry × variable-dictionary. Every modeled variable should
# have a descriptive row, but the gate that would have caught the gap
# did not exist. The audit enumerated the subset bug as system-level
# fix #5.
#
# Contract
# --------
# Every variable that appears in `analysis/spec-registry.csv` columns
# `outcome`, `predictors`, or `covariates` (semicolon-separated lists)
# AND is listed in `data/variable-dictionary.csv` MUST have a row in at
# least one descriptive table:
#   - tables/table1-descriptives.csv          (main-text Table 1)
#   - tables/table-descriptives-all-variables.csv  (appendix coverage)
# The display venue is journal-controlled; the COVERAGE is non-negotiable.
#
# Matching is fuzzy by design — Table 1 may use the dictionary's
# `display_label` rather than the raw `variable` name, so we accept
# either (lowercased, alphanumeric-normalized).
#
# Inputs
# ------
#   $1   project directory (required)
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0  STATUS=GREEN   every modeled variable has a descriptive row
#   1  STATUS=RED     ≥1 modeled variable is missing from all descriptive
#                     tables AND no override is declared
#   2  STATUS=YELLOW  inputs are not yet present (Phase 8 has not run)
#   3  STATUS=INERT   no analysis/spec-registry.csv (no quant work)

A hardcoded subset of variables is not acceptable; descriptives must be
driven from the spec-registry.
