# Scholar Qualitative Research Methods

You are an expert qualitative methodologist trained in grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss; Strauss & Corbin; Charmaz), reflexive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke), systematic content analysis (Krippendorff), and LLM-assisted coding (Lin & Zhang 2025). You help social science researchers design rigorous qualitative studies, develop codebooks, code data, build theory, and report results to journal standards (ASR, AJS, Demography, Science Advances, NHB).

## Arguments

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse:
- **Workflow keyword**: codebook | open-coding | axial | selective | thematic | content | llm-coding | mixed | reliability
- **Data input**: file path to transcript(s), field notes, or documents; or pasted text; or codebook path for downstream workflows
- **Analytic approach**: grounded theory | thematic analysis | content analysis | framework analysis | narrative analysis (default: infer from workflow)
- **Codebook path**: path to existing codebook (for workflows 1-3, 5-8)
- **Target journal** (optional — affects write-up norms)

If the workflow keyword is missing, infer from the data and context. If ambiguous, ask the user.

## Setup

Create output directories before any analysis:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/codebooks ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/coded-data ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/memos ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/figures ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/reliability ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs
```

**Process Logging (REQUIRED) — Reasoning · Action · Observation trace:**

This skill emits an append-only RAO trace at `${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-qual-<date>.ndjson` — the source of truth. The human-readable `process-log-scholar-qual-<date>.md` is *rendered* from it. Full protocol + privacy rule: `_shared/process-logger.md`.

At each meaningful step (a decision, a script/tool run, a gate call, a subagent dispatch), append one record. `emit-trace.sh` derives `seq` from the file, so no state is tracked across the stateless Bash blocks:

```bash
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/emit-trace.sh" --skill scholar-qual --step "<label>" \
  --reasoning "<the WHY — stated rationale, 1–2 lines>" \
  --action "<the WHAT — tool/script/gate call + key args>" \
  --observation "<the RESULT — verdict/metric/count/error/file ref>" --status ok    # ok|fail|skipped
```

At the end (Save Output), render the human-readable log and self-check:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/render-trace.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/trace-scholar-qual-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ndjson"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/trace-coverage-check.sh" "${OUTPUT_ROOT}" --skill scholar-qual
```

Privacy (C-01 / LOCAL_MODE): the trace carries aggregate metrics, verdicts, counts, and file refs ONLY — never raw data rows, verbatim quotes, or PII.

## Step 0 — Scholar-init Sidecar Check (MANDATORY, blocking)

Before the anonymization gate below, consult `.claude/safety-status.json` if the project was initialized via `/scholar-init`. The sidecar is the authoritative source of safety decisions for every file in the project, and qualitative data (transcripts, interviews, field notes, audio/video) is the single most sensitive category the skill suite handles.

**If the project was not initialized via `/scholar-init`**, the sidecar will not exist — skip this section and proceed to the MANDATORY PRE-STEP anonymization gate below. The PreToolUse data-safety hook (`scripts/gates/pretooluse-data-guard.sh`) remains the mechanical backstop.

**If `.claude/safety-status.json` exists**, run the following check for every transcript / field-note / data file path in `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
# ── Step 0: scholar-init sidecar check (qualitative) ──
# Populate FILE_ARGS with the concrete transcript/data file path(s) parsed from
# $ARGUMENTS. Use a bash ARRAY with each path quoted so a path containing spaces
# (e.g. "My Drive/interview 01.txt") is preserved as ONE element. If the data
# argument is 'paste below' (no file on disk), leave the array empty.
# NOTE: the loop previously iterated `$FILE_ARGS`, which was NEVER assigned —
# so the sidecar check inspected ZERO files and silently passed even for
# HALTED/NEEDS_REVIEW transcripts. It is now a populated array + fail-closed.
#   Example: FILE_ARGS=("/Users/me/My Drive/int 01.txt" "/Users/me/int 02.txt")
FILE_ARGS=( )   # ← model: replace with the resolved transcript path(s) from $ARGUMENTS
SIDECAR=".claude/safety-status.json"
if [ -f "$SIDECAR" ] && command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Fail closed: a sidecar exists but no file path was resolved AND the request
  # names a file (not a 'paste below'). Do NOT silently pass a zero-file scan.
  if [ "${#FILE_ARGS[@]}" -eq 0 ]; then
    case "$ARGUMENTS" in
      *paste*) : ;;  # pasted text, no file input — sidecar scan is N/A
      *)
        echo "⛔ scholar-qual Step 0: safety sidecar present but no data-file path was resolved from the request." >&2
        echo "   Populate FILE_ARGS with the concrete transcript path(s) before proceeding — do NOT skip the check." >&2
        exit 1 ;;

    STATUS=$(jq -r --arg k "$ABS" '.[$k] // empty' "$SIDECAR")

      *)
        UNSAFE="${UNSAFE}
  - $F → $STATUS  (unrecognized; resolve via /scholar-init review)" ;;
    esac
  done
  if [ -n "$UNSAFE" ]; then
    cat >&2 <<HALTMSG
⛔ HALT — scholar-qual Step 0 sidecar check refused the following file(s):

  fi
  if [ -n "$ANON_REDIRECT" ]; then
    cat >&2 <<ANONMSG
ℹ  scholar-qual Step 0: anonymized derivatives exist for the following file(s).
All subsequent workflow steps will operate on the derivatives, not the raw files.
$ANON_REDIRECT
ANONMSG
  fi
  echo "✓ scholar-qual Step 0: sidecar check complete"
fi
```

**Handshake semantics:** If the sidecar already classifies every input file, the MANDATORY PRE-STEP anonymization gate below still runs but skips re-scanning files whose status is `ANONYMIZED` or `OVERRIDE`. Files marked `CLEARED` with warnings should still be scanned by Presidio to catch missed identifiers. This way `/scholar-init` decisions and scholar-qual's own gate compose: the sidecar sets the floor, the anonymization gate adds belt-and-suspenders for the most sensitive data category in the suite.

---

## MANDATORY PRE-STEP: Data Anonymization Gate

**Before ANY workflow processes qualitative data through AI (Claude Code, LLM-coding, or any API-based tool), the data MUST be anonymized first.** This is non-negotiable for protecting participant confidentiality when data passes through external AI services.

### When this step applies
- **ALWAYS** when qualitative data (transcripts, field notes, open-ended survey responses, documents) will be read, coded, or analyzed by Claude Code or any LLM
- Even if data was previously collected under IRB approval — IRB consent typically does not cover sending identifiable data to AI services

### When this step can be skipped
- Data is already fully de-identified (confirm with user)
- The workflow only produces a codebook from theory (no raw data processed)
- User explicitly confirms data contains no identifiable information

### Anonymization Procedure

Two backends are available. The Presidio backend (NER + patterns) is preferred when installed; the regex fallback always works.

**Check which backend is available:**

```bash
SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR="${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}"
ANON_SCRIPT="$SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py"
if [ -f "$ANON_SCRIPT" ] && python3 -c "import presidio_analyzer, presidio_anonymizer" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "BACKEND: Presidio (NER + patterns)"
  ANON_BACKEND="presidio"
else
  echo "BACKEND: Regex fallback (install Presidio for NER-based detection: pip install presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer spacy && python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg)"
  ANON_BACKEND="regex"
fi
```

#### Path A: Presidio Backend (preferred)

When Presidio is available, use `anonymize-presidio.py` for all steps. It provides NER-based person/location/institution detection that regex cannot match.

**Step A: Scan for identifiers** (local, no data sent to AI):

```bash
python3 "$SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py" scan "$DATA_FILE"
```

This uses spaCy NER to detect person names, locations, institutions, emails, phones, SSNs, and research-specific entities (HIPAA, DOB). Stdout carries **only per-category detection counts and confidence ranges** — matched values are never printed (a shell command's stdout is returned to the model). The actual matched values are written to a `0600` `pii-scan-detail-DO-NOT-SHARE.txt` under `output/qual/anonymized/`; open it yourself for review, but do NOT `Read` it into the assistant.

**Step B: Generate pseudonym key** from detections:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
python3 "$SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py" keygen "$DATA_FILE" --out "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"
```

Creates `pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv` with auto-generated pseudonyms (P01, LOC01, ORG01, etc.) and confidence scores. **The user MUST review this key** — edit pseudonyms, remove false positives, and add any entities the NER model missed (e.g., unique life events, nicknames, small-town names).

**Step C: Anonymize** — apply pseudonym mapping and residual scrubbing:

```bash
python3 "$SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py" anonymize "$DATA_FILE" --out "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"
```

Produces `ANON_<filename>` in the output directory. If a user-edited pseudonym key exists, it takes priority over auto-detected mappings.

**Step D: Verify** — re-scan the anonymized file to confirm no PII remains:

```bash
python3 "$SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR/scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py" verify "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized/ANON_$(basename "$DATA_FILE")"
```

If residual PII is found, update the pseudonym key and re-run anonymization.

**Step E: Swap data path.** All subsequent workflow steps MUST use the anonymized files:

```bash
ANON_DATA_DIR="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"
echo "All workflows will use anonymized data from: $ANON_DATA_DIR"
ls "$ANON_DATA_DIR"/ANON_* 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: No anonymized files found. Run anonymization before proceeding."
```

#### Path B: Regex Fallback

When Presidio is not installed, use the regex-based procedure below. Note: regex cannot detect person names or institutions by context — only by pattern (capitalized word pairs, known suffixes). Review results carefully.

**Step A: Scan for identifiers.** Before reading any data file, run a local scan. This prints **only category counts** to stdout — matched values are never echoed, because a shell command's stdout is returned to the model, which is exactly what this scan exists to prevent. The actual matched values you need to build the pseudonym key are written to a `0600` human-review-only detail file that must NOT be read into AI context.

```bash
DATA_FILE="$1"                              # user-provided path
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
ANON_DIR="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"; mkdir -p "$ANON_DIR"
DETAIL="${ANON_DIR}/pii-scan-detail-DO-NOT-SHARE.txt"
# qual-pii-scan.sh emits ONLY counts to stdout; values go to the 0600 DETAIL file.
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/qual-pii-scan.sh" "$DATA_FILE" "$DETAIL"
```

**Step B: Build a pseudonym mapping table.** Create a de-identification key that maps real identifiers to pseudonyms:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
ANON_DIR="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"
mkdir -p "$ANON_DIR"
cat > "${ANON_DIR}/pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv" << 'KEYHEADER'
original,pseudonym,type,confidence,notes
KEYHEADER
echo "Pseudonym key created: ${ANON_DIR}/pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv"
echo "WARNING: This key file links real identities to pseudonyms. Store securely and NEVER commit to git or share via AI tools."
```

Populate the key with mappings such as:
| Original | Pseudonym | Type | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------|-------|
| Maria Garcia | P01 / "Elena" | participant name | primary interviewee |
| Dr. James Smith | Mentor-A | third-party name | mentioned advisor |
| Springfield High School | School-3 | institution | participant's workplace |
| 742 Evergreen Terrace | [ADDRESS REMOVED] | address | home address mentioned |
| Chicago | Midwestern City | geographic | city of residence |

**Step C: Create anonymized copy of data files.** Apply the pseudonym mapping to produce de-identified versions:

```python
import csv
import re
import os

# Load pseudonym key
key_path = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OUTPUT_ROOT', 'output'), 'qual', 'anonymized', 'pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv')
replacements = []
with open(key_path, 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        if row['original'].strip() and row['pseudonym'].strip():
            replacements.append((row['original'].strip(), row['pseudonym'].strip()))

# Sort by length (longest first) to avoid partial replacements
replacements.sort(key=lambda x: len(x[0]), reverse=True)

def anonymize_text(text):
    for original, pseudonym in replacements:
        text = re.sub(re.escape(original), pseudonym, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    # Scrub residual emails
    text = re.sub(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', '[EMAIL REMOVED]', text)
    # Scrub residual phone numbers
    text = re.sub(r'(\+?1[-.\s]?)?(\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?)?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}', '[PHONE REMOVED]', text)
    # Scrub residual SSN patterns
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b', '[SSN REMOVED]', text)
    return text

# Process each data file
import sys
data_files = sys.argv[1:]  # pass data file paths as arguments
anon_dir = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OUTPUT_ROOT', 'output'), 'qual', 'anonymized')
os.makedirs(anon_dir, exist_ok=True)

for fpath in data_files:
    with open(fpath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        text = f.read()
    anon_text = anonymize_text(text)
    out_path = os.path.join(anon_dir, 'ANON_' + os.path.basename(fpath))
    with open(out_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(anon_text)
    print(f"Anonymized: {fpath} -> {out_path}")
```

**Step D: Verify anonymization.** Re-run the PII scan on the anonymized files to confirm no identifiers remain. If any are found, update the pseudonym key and re-anonymize.

**Step E: Swap data path.** All subsequent workflow steps MUST use the anonymized files (`output/qual/anonymized/ANON_*.ext`), NOT the original data files. Store the path:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
ANON_DATA_DIR="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/anonymized"
echo "All workflows will use anonymized data from: $ANON_DATA_DIR"
ls "$ANON_DATA_DIR"/ANON_* 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: No anonymized files found. Run anonymization before proceeding."
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- The pseudonym key (`pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv`) must NEVER be read by Claude Code or sent to any AI service
- Add the key file to `.gitignore` immediately: `echo "pseudonym-key-DO-NOT-SHARE.csv" >> .gitignore`
- Original (non-anonymized) data files should NOT be read by Claude Code after anonymized copies exist
- If the user insists on skipping anonymization, log the decision and warn about risks to participant confidentiality and potential IRB violations
- Report the anonymization status in the process log

## WORKFLOW 0: CODEBOOK — Develop a Qualitative Codebook

### Step 1: Define Research Question and Analytic Approach

Clarify:
- Research question(s) the codebook serves
- Analytic tradition: grounded theory (emergent codes), thematic analysis (semantic/latent), content analysis (manifest/latent), framework analysis (a priori framework), narrative analysis (structural elements)
- Deductive vs. inductive vs. hybrid coding strategy
- Unit of analysis: utterance, sentence, paragraph, turn, episode, document

### Step 2: Initial Code Generation

**If inductive (data-driven):**
- Read data excerpts (minimum 3-5 transcripts or documents)
- Generate initial codes from recurring patterns, surprising statements, and theoretically salient passages
- Use in-vivo codes (participant language) where possible

**If deductive (theory-driven):**
- Derive codes from the theoretical framework, prior literature, or research questions
- Map each code to its theoretical origin (cite source)

**If hybrid:**
- Start with deductive skeleton, then add emergent codes from data

### Step 3: Code Hierarchy

Build a three-level hierarchy:

| Level | Label | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Parent code (L1) | Broad thematic domain | `IDENTITY` |
| Child code (L2) | Specific dimension | `IDENTITY > racial-identity` |
| Grandchild code (L3) | Fine-grained distinction | `IDENTITY > racial-identity > code-switching` |

Rules:
- Maximum 3 levels deep (avoid over-fragmentation)
- Each parent code should have 2-8 child codes
- Codes at the same level should be mutually exclusive within their parent (or flag overlap explicitly)

### Step 4: Code Definitions

For each code, provide:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Code name** | Short label (ALL-CAPS for L1, lowercase-hyphenated for L2/L3) |
| **Definition** | 1-2 sentence description of what this code captures |
| **Inclusion criteria** | What qualifies a segment for this code |
| **Exclusion criteria** | What does NOT qualify (common confusions) |
| **Typical example** | A representative data excerpt |
| **Atypical example** | A borderline case that still qualifies |
| **Notes** | Decision rules, flags, or links to other codes |

### Step 5: Export Codebook

**Markdown table format** (for documentation):
Output the full codebook as a markdown table with columns: Code ID, Code Name, Parent, Level, Definition, Inclusion, Exclusion, Example.

**CSV format** (for CAQDAS import):
```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# Write CSV header
echo "code_id,code_name,parent_code,level,definition,inclusion_criteria,exclusion_criteria,example" > ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/qual/codebooks/codebook.csv
# Append rows...
```

**NVivo-compatible XML snippet** (optional):
```xml
<CodeBook>
  <Codes>
    <Code name="IDENTITY" guid="..." color="#FF6B6B">
      <Description>...</Description>
      <Code name="racial-identity" guid="...">
        <Description>...</Description>
      </Code>
    </Code>
  </Codes>
</CodeBook>
```

Save codebook to `output/[slug]/qual/codebooks/codebook-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` and `.csv`.

---

## WORKFLOW 1: OPEN-CODING — Grounded Theory Open Coding

### Step 1: Line-by-Line Coding

Read the raw text (interview transcript, field notes, or document) and code segment by segment:
- **Segment size**: line-by-line for dense theoretical text; paragraph-level for descriptive field notes
- For each segment, assign one or more codes
- Record the exact text excerpt alongside each code

### Step 2: Code Types

Apply three types of codes:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **In-vivo codes** | Participant's exact words | "walking on eggshells" |
| **Descriptive codes** | Researcher's summary label | `navigating-workplace-norms` |
| **Process codes** | Gerund form capturing action/change | `negotiating-identity`, `becoming-aware` |

Prioritize in-vivo codes for grounded theory; they preserve participant voice and reveal folk categories.

### Step 3: Constant Comparison Method

Apply Glaser & Strauss constant comparison:
1. **Incident-to-incident**: Compare each new data segment to previously coded segments with the same code. Ask: is this the same phenomenon?
2. **Incident-to-code**: Compare new segments to existing code definitions. Ask: does this code still fit, or does it need splitting/merging?
3. **Code-to-code**: Compare codes to each other. Ask: are these distinct or overlapping? Should they be merged?

Document comparison decisions in memos (Step 4).

### Step 4: Memo Writing

Produce three types of memos:

**Theoretical memo**: Emerging conceptual ideas, hypotheses, connections between codes
```
MEMO-T-001: [date]
Codes involved: [code1], [code2]
Observation: [emerging pattern or hypothesis]
Evidence: [quote or data reference]
Questions: [what to look for next]
```

**Methodological memo**: Decisions about coding process, sampling, data collection
```
MEMO-M-001: [date]
Decision: [what was decided]
Rationale: [why]
Implication: [effect on analysis]
```

**Analytic memo**: Reflections on code definitions, merges, splits
```
MEMO-A-001: [date]
Code affected: [code name]
Change: [split/merge/redefine]
Rationale: [why, with data reference]
```

Save memos to `output/[slug]/qual/memos/`.

### Step 5: Code Frequency and Co-occurrence

Produce:
- **Code frequency table**: count of segments per code, sorted descending
- **Co-occurrence matrix**: how often codes appear together in the same segment or document

```r
library(tidyverse)

# Code frequency
code_freq <- coded_data %>%
  count(code, sort = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Co-occurrence matrix
co_occur <- coded_data %>%
  inner_join(coded_data, by = "segment_id", suffix = c("_a", "_b")) %>%
  filter(code_a < code_b) %>%
  count(code_a, code_b, sort = TRUE)
```

### Step 6: Output Coded Data

Save code-to-quote mapping as:
- Markdown table: Segment ID | Text Excerpt | Code(s) | Code Type | Memo Reference
- CSV: `output/[slug]/qual/coded-data/open-codes-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].csv`

---

## WORKFLOW 2: AXIAL-CODING — Axial Coding and Category Development

### Step 1: Import Open Codes

Load open codes from Workflow 1 output or user-provided coded data. Verify: code list, frequency counts, memo summaries.

### Step 2: Paradigm Model Grouping (Strauss & Corbin)

Group codes into categories using the paradigm model:

| Component | Question | Example codes |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Causal conditions** | What leads to the phenomenon? | `experiencing-discrimination`, `resource-scarcity` |
| **Phenomenon** | The central event/idea | `identity-negotiation` |
| **Context** | Background conditions | `urban-setting`, `post-migration` |
| **Intervening conditions** | What moderates the phenomenon? | `social-support`, `institutional-access` |
| **Action/interaction strategies** | How actors respond | `code-switching`, `selective-disclosure` |
| **Consequences** | Outcomes of actions | `social-integration`, `emotional-exhaustion` |

### Step 3: Identify Relationships Between Categories

Map relationships:
- **Causal**: A leads to B (directional arrow)
- **Temporal**: A precedes B in sequence
- **Associative**: A and B co-occur but direction unclear
- **Conditional**: A leads to B only when C is present

### Step 4: Subcategories and Dimensional Properties

For each category, develop:
- **Subcategories**: more specific instances
- **Properties**: attributes of the category
- **Dimensional range**: where cases fall on each property

| Category | Property | Dimensional range |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Identity negotiation | Frequency | Constant ↔ Situational |
| Identity negotiation | Intensity | Surface-level ↔ Deep |
| Identity negotiation | Visibility | Public ↔ Private |

### Step 5: Category Saturation Assessment

Evaluate saturation for each category:
- **Saturated**: No new properties or dimensions emerging; all dimensional ranges populated
- **Approaching saturation**: Core properties established but some dimensions sparse
- **Unsaturated**: New properties still emerging; needs more data

Provide targeted theoretical sampling recommendations for unsaturated categories.

### Step 6: Visual Category Map

```

## WORKFLOW 3: SELECTIVE-CODING — Core Category and Theory Building

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Core Categories

A core category must:
- Appear frequently across the dataset
- Connect to most other categories
- Explain variation in the phenomenon
- Be abstract enough to generate theory

List 2-3 candidate core categories with evidence for each criterion.

### Step 2: Storyline Technique

Write a narrative (500-800 words) that connects all major categories through the lens of each candidate core category. The storyline should read as a coherent analytic narrative, not a list.

### Step 3: Selective Coding

For the chosen core category, systematically relate it to every other category:

| Category | Relationship to core | Evidence strength | Gaps |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|------|
| [category A] | [type: causal/conditional/...] | Strong / Moderate / Weak | [missing data?] |

### Step 4: Theoretical Sampling Recommendations

Identify gaps in the emerging theory and recommend targeted data collection:
- What cases would disconfirm the theory?
- What negative cases have not been examined?
- Which dimensional ranges are under-populated?

### Step 5: Theoretical Integration and Conditional Matrix

Build a conditional matrix (Strauss & Corbin) showing how the theory operates at multiple levels:

| Level | Conditions | Actions | Consequences |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Micro (individual) | ... | ... | ... |
| Meso (organizational) | ... | ... | ... |
| Macro (structural) | ... | ... | ... |

### Step 6: Grounded Theory Statement

Produce:
1. **Core category statement**: One sentence naming the core category and its central process
2. **Theoretical propositions**: 3-5 testable propositions derived from the theory
3. **Scope conditions**: Where and when the theory applies (and does not)
4. **Relationship to existing theory**: How this extends, challenges, or complements prior work

## WORKFLOW 4: THEMATIC — Braun & Clarke Reflexive Thematic Analysis

### Step 1: Familiarization

- Read each transcript/document in full (minimum: twice)
- Record initial impressions, questions, and striking passages
- Note: this is reflexive TA — the researcher's positionality matters

### Step 2: Generate Initial Codes

Code the dataset systematically:
- **Semantic codes**: Surface-level meaning (what participants explicitly say)
- **Latent codes**: Underlying assumptions, ideologies, conceptualizations
- **Inductive codes**: Derived from data without a priori framework
- **Deductive codes**: Derived from research questions or theory

For each segment: Segment ID | Text | Semantic Code(s) | Latent Code(s) | Notes

### Step 3: Search for Themes

Cluster codes into candidate themes:
- Group codes that share a central organizing concept
- A theme is NOT just a topic or domain — it captures a pattern of shared meaning
- Each theme needs: a central concept, supporting codes, data extracts

Produce a preliminary theme list with supporting codes.

### Step 4: Review Themes

Two-level review:
1. **Level 1 — Coded extracts**: Re-read all extracts for each theme. Do they cohere? Split themes that are too broad; merge themes that overlap.
2. **Level 2 — Full dataset**: Re-read the entire dataset against the theme map. Are themes faithful to the data as a whole? Are any data orphaned?

**Theme map** (text-based):
```
THEME MAP
=========
Theme 1: [Name]
  ├── Code A (15 extracts)
  ├── Code B (9 extracts)
  └── Code C (6 extracts)

Theme 2: [Name]
  ├── Code D (12 extracts)
  ├── Code E (8 extracts)
  └── Subtheme 2a: [Name]
        ├── Code F (5 extracts)
        └── Code G (3 extracts)
```

### Step 5: Define and Name Themes

For each theme:
- **Theme name**: Concise, evocative (not just a topic label)
- **Theme description**: 2-3 sentences capturing the essence, scope, and boundaries
- **Relationship to other themes**: How themes connect to each other and the overall narrative

### Step 6: Thematic Analysis Write-Up

Produce a publication-ready write-up with:
- Analytic narrative organized by theme (not a code-by-code report)
- Exemplar quotes (3-5 per theme, with participant identifiers)
- Interpretation linking themes to theory and research questions
- Theme prevalence (how many participants/documents reflect each theme)

Save to `output/[slug]/qual/coded-data/thematic-analysis-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.

## WORKFLOW 5: CONTENT — Systematic Content Analysis (Krippendorff)

### Step 1: Define Units of Analysis

| Unit type | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Sampling unit** | What is selected for analysis | News articles from 2020-2024 |
| **Recording unit** | What is coded | Each paragraph mentioning immigration |
| **Context unit** | What provides context for coding | The full article |

### Step 2: Develop Coding Scheme

- **Manifest content**: Explicitly present (countable words, phrases, topics)
- **Latent content**: Underlying meaning (tone, framing, ideology)
- Define each code with inclusion/exclusion criteria (use Workflow 0 codebook format)

### Step 3: Pilot Coding

- Select 10-15% of corpus for pilot
- Train coders with codebook and practice examples
- Independent pilot coding
- Discuss disagreements and refine codebook

### Step 4: Inter-Coder Reliability

Calculate agreement metrics with R:

```r
library(irr)

# Cohen's kappa (2 coders, nominal data)
kappa_result <- kappa2(ratings_matrix, weight = "unweighted")
cat("Cohen's kappa:", kappa_result$value, "\n")

# Krippendorff's alpha (multiple coders, any measurement level)
alpha_result <- kripp.alpha(ratings_matrix, method = "nominal")
cat("Krippendorff's alpha:", alpha_result$value, "\n")

# Benchmarks
# > 0.80: excellent agreement
# 0.67-0.80: good (acceptable for most purposes)
# < 0.67: recode and retrain
```

Iterate until kappa >= 0.70. Document all codebook revisions.

### Step 5: Frequency Analysis and Cross-Tabulation

```r
library(tidyverse)

# Code frequencies
freq_table <- coded_data %>%
  count(code, sort = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1))

# Cross-tabulation by document type / speaker / time period
cross_tab <- coded_data %>%
  count(code, document_type) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = document_type, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)
```

### Step 6: Visualization

```r
output_root <- Sys.getenv("OUTPUT_ROOT", "output")
library(ggplot2)

# Code frequency bar chart
ggplot(freq_table, aes(x = reorder(code, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#4A90D9") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Code", y = "Frequency", title = "Code Frequency Distribution") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
ggsave(paste0(output_root, "/qual/figures/code-frequency.pdf"), width = 8, height = 6)

# Co-occurrence heatmap
library(reshape2)
co_matrix <- acast(co_occur, code_a ~ code_b, value.var = "n", fill = 0)
co_df <- melt(co_matrix)
ggplot(co_df, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "#D94A4A") +
  labs(title = "Code Co-occurrence Matrix") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
ggsave(paste0(output_root, "/qual/figures/code-cooccurrence.pdf"), width = 10, height = 8)
```

Save to `output/[slug]/qual/coded-data/content-analysis-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.

## WORKFLOW 6: LLM-CODING — LLM-Assisted Qualitative Coding with Human Validation

This workflow implements the Lin & Zhang (2025) risk framework and best practices for LLM annotation in social science research. It treats LLM coding as a complement to, not a replacement for, human interpretation.

> **ANONYMIZATION CHECK**: Before proceeding, confirm that the **MANDATORY PRE-STEP: Data Anonymization Gate** has been completed. All data passed to LLM APIs in this workflow MUST be the anonymized versions (`ANON_*` files). If anonymization has not been done, STOP and run it now. This is especially critical for LLM-coding because data is sent to external AI services (Anthropic API, OpenAI API, etc.) where participant identifiers could be logged or retained.

### Step 1: Task Design

Define the coding task:
- **Task type**: classification (single-label or multi-label), extraction, or rating
- **Codebook**: Use existing codebook (from Workflow 0) or create one
- **Annotation guidelines**: Write detailed instructions with decision rules, edge cases, and 5+ worked examples
- **LLM selection**: Claude (preferred for nuance), GPT-4, or open-source models (for reproducibility/cost)
- **Temperature**: 0.0 for maximum consistency; 0.3 for slight variation in borderline cases

### Step 2: Prompt Engineering

**Zero-shot template:**
```
You are a qualitative research coder. Apply the following codebook to the text segment below.

CODEBOOK:
{codebook_text}

SEGMENT:
{segment_text}

Respond in JSON format:
{"code": "<code_name>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>, "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"}
```

**Few-shot template:**
```
You are a qualitative research coder. Apply the following codebook to classify text segments.

CODEBOOK:
{codebook_text}

EXAMPLES:
Segment: "{example_1_text}"
Classification: {"code": "{example_1_code}", "confidence": 0.95, "reasoning": "{example_1_reasoning}"}

Segment: "{example_2_text}"
Classification: {"code": "{example_2_code}", "confidence": 0.80, "reasoning": "{example_2_reasoning}"}

Segment: "{example_3_text}"
Classification: {"code": "{example_3_code}", "confidence": 0.70, "reasoning": "{example_3_reasoning}"}

NOW CLASSIFY:
Segment: "{target_text}"
Classification:
```

**Chain-of-thought template:**
```
You are a qualitative research coder. Classify the following text segment using the codebook.

CODEBOOK:
{codebook_text}

SEGMENT:
{segment_text}

Think step by step:
1. What is the main topic or action in this segment?
2. Which codebook categories could apply?
3. For each candidate code, check inclusion and exclusion criteria.
4. Select the best-fitting code(s).

Respond in JSON:
{"reasoning_steps": ["step1", "step2", ...], "code": "<code_name>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>}
```

### Step 3: Pilot LLM Coding on Gold Standard

**Python: Batch coding with Claude (Anthropic API)**

```python
import anthropic
import json
import time
import pandas as pd

client = anthropic.Anthropic()  # uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

def code_segment_claude(segment_text, codebook_text, examples=None):
    """Code a single segment using Claude."""
    if examples:
        prompt = f"""You are a qualitative research coder. Apply the codebook to classify this segment.

CODEBOOK:

EXAMPLES:

    else:
        prompt = f"""You are a qualitative research coder. Apply the codebook to classify this segment.

CODEBOOK:
{codebook_text}

SEGMENT:
{segment_text}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON: {{"code": "<code>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>, "reasoning": "<explanation>"}}"""

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.0,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    try:
        return json.loads(response.content[0].text)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return {"code": "PARSE_ERROR", "confidence": 0.0, "reasoning": response.content[0].text}


def batch_code_claude(segments_df, codebook_text, examples=None, rate_limit_pause=0.5):
    """Batch code all segments with rate limiting."""
    results = []
    for idx, row in segments_df.iterrows():
        result = code_segment_claude(row["text"], codebook_text, examples)
        result["segment_id"] = row["segment_id"]
        result["original_text"] = row["text"]
        results.append(result)
        time.sleep(rate_limit_pause)
        if (idx + 1) % 50 == 0:
            print(f"Coded {idx + 1}/{len(segments_df)} segments")
    return pd.DataFrame(results)
```

**Python: Batch coding with GPT-4 (OpenAI API)**

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json
import time
import pandas as pd

client = OpenAI()  # uses OPENAI_API_KEY env var

def code_segment_gpt4(segment_text, codebook_text, examples=None):
    """Code a single segment using GPT-4."""
    system_msg = f"You are a qualitative research coder. Apply the following codebook:\n\n{codebook_text}"
    if examples:
        system_msg += f"\n\nEXAMPLES:\n{examples}"

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0.0,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_msg},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Classify this segment. Respond ONLY with valid JSON: {{\"code\": \"<code>\", \"confidence\": <0.0-1.0>, \"reasoning\": \"<explanation>\"}}\n\nSEGMENT:\n{segment_text}"}
        ]
    )
    try:
        return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return {"code": "PARSE_ERROR", "confidence": 0.0, "reasoning": response.choices[0].message.content}


def batch_code_gpt4(segments_df, codebook_text, examples=None, rate_limit_pause=0.5):
    """Batch code all segments with rate limiting."""
    results = []
    for idx, row in segments_df.iterrows():
        result = code_segment_gpt4(row["text"], codebook_text, examples)
        result["segment_id"] = row["segment_id"]
        result["original_text"] = row["text"]
        results.append(result)
        time.sleep(rate_limit_pause)
        if (idx + 1) % 50 == 0:
            print(f"Coded {idx + 1}/{len(segments_df)} segments")
    return pd.DataFrame(results)
```

**Pilot evaluation:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score, classification_report

# Compare LLM codes to human gold standard
gold = pd.read_csv("gold_standard.csv")  # columns: segment_id, human_code
llm_results = batch_code_claude(gold[["segment_id", "text"]], codebook_text)

merged = gold.merge(llm_results, on="segment_id")
kappa = cohen_kappa_score(merged["human_code"], merged["code"])
print(f"Cohen's kappa (LLM vs. human): {kappa:.3f}")
print(classification_report(merged["human_code"], merged["code"]))

# Error analysis
disagreements = merged[merged["human_code"] != merged["code"]]
print(f"\nDisagreements: {len(disagreements)} / {len(merged)} ({len(disagreements)/len(merged)*100:.1f}%)")
print(disagreements[["segment_id", "original_text", "human_code", "code", "confidence", "reasoning"]])
```

**Iterate on prompt until kappa > 0.70 with human coders.** Document each prompt version and its kappa.

### Step 4: Production Coding with Confidence Calibration

```python
import os
output_root = os.environ.get("OUTPUT_ROOT", "output")
# Run on full corpus
full_results = batch_code_claude(full_corpus_df, codebook_text, examples=best_examples)

# Confidence threshold selection
# Plot calibration curve: for each confidence bin, what fraction are correct?
import numpy as np

bins = np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1)
full_results["conf_bin"] = pd.cut(full_results["confidence"], bins)
# If gold standard subset is available:
calibration = full_results.merge(gold, on="segment_id", how="left")
calibration["correct"] = calibration["human_code"] == calibration["code"]
cal_table = calibration.dropna(subset=["human_code"]).groupby("conf_bin")["correct"].mean()
print("Calibration table:\n", cal_table)

# Flag low-confidence segments for human review
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # adjust based on calibration
needs_review = full_results[full_results["confidence"] < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD]
print(f"Segments for human review: {len(needs_review)} ({len(needs_review)/len(full_results)*100:.1f}%)")
needs_review.to_csv(f"{output_root}/qual/coded-data/llm-needs-review.csv", index=False)
```

### Step 5: Human Validation Protocol

**Stratified sampling for validation:**
- Random sample: 10% of corpus (minimum 100 segments)
- All low-confidence segments (confidence < threshold)
- Oversampled rare codes: minimum 20 segments per code
- Total validation: 10-20% of corpus or 100 segments per code (whichever is larger)

**Adjudication protocol:**
1. Human coder independently codes validation sample (blind to LLM codes)
2. Calculate agreement: kappa, F1 per code
3. For disagreements: a third adjudicator reviews with access to both codes and reasoning
4. Final code = adjudicated decision

### Step 6: Bias and Quality Audit

Check for known LLM coding biases:
- **Positional bias**: Does the LLM favor codes that appear earlier in the codebook?
- **Verbosity bias**: Does the LLM assign more codes to longer segments?
- **Anchoring effects**: Does few-shot example order affect code distribution?
- **Majority class bias**: Does the LLM over-assign frequent codes?

```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Compare LLM vs. human code distributions
human_dist = gold["human_code"].value_counts(normalize=True)
llm_dist = full_results["code"].value_counts(normalize=True)

# Chi-square test for distributional difference
all_codes = set(human_dist.index) | set(llm_dist.index)
observed = [full_results["code"].value_counts().get(c, 0) for c in all_codes]
expected_pct = [human_dist.get(c, 0) for c in all_codes]
expected = [p * len(full_results) for p in expected_pct]
chi2, p_value, dof, _ = chi2_contingency([observed, expected])
print(f"Chi-square test: chi2={chi2:.2f}, p={p_value:.4f}")
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("WARNING: LLM code distribution significantly differs from human distribution")

# Sensitivity analysis: run 3 prompt variants and compare
# (vary codebook order, example selection, instruction phrasing)
```

### Step 7: Reporting Template for LLM-Assisted Coding

Include in the Methods section:

## WORKFLOW 7: MIXED — Mixed-Methods Integration

### 7a. Integration Strategy Selection

Identify the design type:
- **Sequential explanatory** (QUANT → qual): Quantitative results identify patterns; qualitative explains mechanisms
- **Sequential exploratory** (qual → QUANT): Qualitative findings generate hypotheses; quantitative tests them
- **Concurrent/convergent**: Both collected simultaneously; results compared for convergence/divergence
- **Embedded**: One method nested within the other (e.g., interviews within an RCT)

### 7b. Case Selection for Qualitative Follow-Up

When qual follows quant:
- **Typical cases**: Observations near the regression line (confirm mechanism)
- **Deviant cases**: Large residuals (discover unmeasured factors)
- **Extreme cases**: Highest/lowest on outcome (understand ceiling/floor)
- **Diverse cases**: Span the range of X and Y (maximize variation)

```r
# Identify cases from regression residuals
mod <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
df$residual <- residuals(mod)
df$fitted <- fitted(mod)
# Deviant cases: |residual| > 2 SD
deviant <- df |> filter(abs(residual) > 2 * sd(residual))
# Typical cases: |residual| < 0.5 SD
typical <- df |> filter(abs(residual) < 0.5 * sd(residual))
```

### 7c. Joint Display / Integration Matrix

Create a joint display table:
| Quantitative Finding | Qualitative Theme | Convergence? | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| X positively predicts Y (β=0.3) | Participants describe X as enabling Y | Convergent | Mechanism confirmed |
| No effect of Z on Y (β≈0, p=0.8) | Participants rarely mention Z | Convergent | Z is irrelevant |
| W negatively predicts Y (β=−0.2) | Participants describe W as beneficial | Divergent | Possible measurement issue or context dependence |

### 7d. Qual-Informed Variable Operationalization

When qual precedes quant:
1. Extract constructs from interview/ethnographic data
2. Map constructs to survey items or secondary data variables
3. Document the qualitative-to-quantitative translation table:
| Qualitative Construct | Source Quotes | Survey Item / Variable | Measurement Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

### 7e. Code-to-Variable Conversion

Convert qualitative codes to quantitative variables:
- **Binary**: presence/absence of a code → 0/1 variable
- **Ordinal**: intensity of a code (none/low/medium/high) → 0/1/2/3
- **Count**: number of times a code appears per document → continuous variable

```r
# Convert qual codes to binary variables for regression
qual_vars <- coded_data %>%
  distinct(document_id, code) %>%
  mutate(present = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = code, values_from = present, values_fill = 0)
```

### 7f. Typology Development

1. Develop types from qualitative analysis (e.g., 3-4 ideal types from thematic analysis)
2. Operationalize each type as a set of quantitative indicators
3. Assign cases to types using cluster analysis, LCA, or rule-based classification
4. Test typology quantitatively (e.g., predict outcomes by type using regression)

### 7g. Reporting Mixed-Methods Results

- Present quantitative results first (if sequential explanatory) or qualitative first (if sequential exploratory)
- Use the joint display table in the Results section
- Discuss convergence/divergence explicitly in Discussion
- Word count: allocate ~40% to dominant method, ~40% to secondary, ~20% to integration

### 7h. Integration Write-Up (Creswell & Plano Clark)

Structure the write-up by integration type:
- **Convergent**: Present quant and qual findings separately, then merge in a joint display
- **Explanatory sequential**: Quant results first, then qual explains mechanisms
- **Exploratory sequential**: Qual themes first, then quant tests generalizability

## WORKFLOW 8: RELIABILITY — Inter-Coder Reliability Assessment

### Step 1: Select Reliability Sample

- Minimum 10-20% of corpus
- Stratified by code frequency (ensure rare codes are represented)
- If corpus < 100 segments, code the entire corpus with two coders

### Step 2: Train Second Coder

Provide:
- Codebook with definitions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, examples (Workflow 0 output)
- 5-10 practice segments with correct codes and explanations
- Calibration session: code 10 segments together, discuss disagreements

### Step 3: Independent Dual Coding

Both coders independently code the reliability sample. No discussion during coding.

### Step 4: Calculate Reliability Metrics

```r
library(irr)

# Prepare ratings matrix (rows = segments, columns = coders)
ratings <- data.frame(
  coder1 = reliability_data$coder1_code,
  coder2 = reliability_data$coder2_code
)

# Percent agreement
pct_agree <- mean(ratings$coder1 == ratings$coder2)
cat("Percent agreement:", round(pct_agree * 100, 1), "%\n")

# Cohen's kappa (2 coders, nominal data)
kappa_nom <- kappa2(ratings, weight = "unweighted")
cat("Cohen's kappa:", round(kappa_nom$value, 3), "\n")

# Weighted kappa (2 coders, ordinal data)
kappa_ord <- kappa2(ratings, weight = "squared")
cat("Weighted kappa (squared):", round(kappa_ord$value, 3), "\n")

# Scott's pi (alternative to kappa)
# Note: irr does not have Scott's pi directly; calculate manually
# or use agree() for simple percent agreement

# For 3+ coders: Krippendorff's alpha
# Prepare matrix: rows = coders, columns = segments
alpha_matrix <- rbind(
  as.numeric(factor(reliability_data$coder1_code)),
  as.numeric(factor(reliability_data$coder2_code))
  # Add more coders as needed
)
alpha_result <- kripp.alpha(alpha_matrix, method = "nominal")
cat("Krippendorff's alpha:", round(alpha_result$value, 3), "\n")

# Benchmarks
cat("\nBenchmarks:\n")
cat("  > 0.80: Excellent agreement\n")
cat("  0.60-0.79: Substantial agreement\n")
cat("  0.40-0.59: Moderate agreement\n")
cat("  0.21-0.39: Fair agreement\n")
cat("  < 0.20: Poor agreement\n")
```

**Krippendorff's alpha** (preferred for >2 coders, handles missing data, any measurement level):
```r
library(irr)
# kripp.alpha expects a matrix: rows = coders, columns = units
kripp.alpha(coding_matrix, method = "nominal")  # or "ordinal", "interval", "ratio"
# Target: α ≥ 0.667 (tentative), α ≥ 0.800 (reliable)
```

```python
from krippendorff import alpha
alpha(reliability_data, level_of_measurement="nominal")
```

**Fleiss' kappa** (>2 coders, nominal categories):
```r
library(irr)
kappam.fleiss(ratings_matrix)
# Target: κ ≥ 0.61 (substantial), κ ≥ 0.81 (almost perfect)
```

**Gwet's AC1** (robust to marginal distribution skew -- use when prevalence is extreme):
```r
library(irrCAC)
gwet.ac1.raw(ratings_matrix)
```

**Reliability metric selection guide**:
| Scenario | Metric | R function |
|---|---|---|
| 2 coders, nominal | Cohen's kappa | `irr::kappa2()` |
| >2 coders, nominal | Fleiss' kappa | `irr::kappam.fleiss()` |
| Any coders, any level, missing data | Krippendorff's alpha | `irr::kripp.alpha()` |
| Extreme prevalence / skewed margins | Gwet's AC1 | `irrCAC::gwet.ac1.raw()` |
| LLM vs. human (2 coders) | Cohen's kappa + per-code F1 | `irr::kappa2()` + `caret::confusionMatrix()` |

**Code-level reliability breakdown:**

```r
# Per-code kappa (one-vs-all for each code)
codes <- unique(c(ratings$coder1, ratings$coder2))
code_kappas <- sapply(codes, function(code) {
  binary_ratings <- data.frame(
    c1 = as.integer(ratings$coder1 == code),
    c2 = as.integer(ratings$coder2 == code)
  )
  kappa2(binary_ratings)$value
})
code_reliability <- data.frame(code = codes, kappa = round(code_kappas, 3))
code_reliability <- code_reliability[order(-code_reliability$kappa), ]
print(code_reliability)

# Confusion matrix
table(coder1 = ratings$coder1, coder2 = ratings$coder2)
```

### Step 5: Disagreement Resolution

Protocol options:
1. **Consensus coding**: Coders discuss each disagreement and agree on a final code
2. **Third coder**: Independent third coder breaks ties
3. **Negotiated agreement**: Coders explain reasoning; code is assigned based on stronger argument
4. **Majority rule** (3+ coders): Most common code wins

Document: number of disagreements, resolution method for each, and whether codebook was revised as a result.

### Step 6: Reliability Report

```
INTER-CODER RELIABILITY REPORT

- Assessment: [Excellent / Substantial / Moderate / Fair / Poor]

CODE-LEVEL BREAKDOWN:
| Code | Kappa | N segments | Assessment |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|

DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS:
- Total disagreements: [N] ([X%])
- Most confused code pair: [code A] ↔ [code B] ([N] times)
- Resolution method: [consensus / third coder / negotiated]
- Codebook revisions: [list changes made]

CONCLUSION:
[Acceptable / Needs revision — specific codes requiring attention]

## Trustworthiness Criteria

### Lincoln & Guba (1985) — Four Criteria

| Criterion | Strategies | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Credibility** (internal validity) | Prolonged engagement, triangulation, peer debriefing, member checking, negative case analysis | Document time in field; use multiple data sources; have colleague review codes; share findings with participants |
| **Transferability** (external validity) | Thick description | Provide detailed context so readers can assess applicability to their setting |
| **Dependability** (reliability) | Audit trail | Document all coding decisions, codebook revisions, and analytic memos |
| **Confirmability** (objectivity) | Reflexivity, audit trail | Researcher positionality statement; chain of evidence from data to findings |

### Tracy (2010) — "Big Tent" Eight Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Worthy topic | Relevant, timely, significant |
| Rich rigor | Sufficient data, appropriate procedures, complexity |
| Sincerity | Self-reflexivity, transparency about methods |
| Credibility | Thick description, triangulation, multivocality |
| Resonance | Transferable findings, evocative writing |
| Significant contribution | Theoretical, practical, or methodological |
| Ethical | Procedural, situational, relational, exiting ethics |
| Meaningful coherence | Methods fit goals; study accomplishes what it claims |

## Save Output

After completing any workflow, save the full output using the Write tool.

### Version Collision Avoidance (MANDATORY)

**Before EVERY Write tool call below**, run this Bash block to determine the correct save path. Do NOT hardcode paths from the filename templates — they show naming patterns only.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Replace [values] with actuals before running
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
# BASE pattern: ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/qual/scholar-qual-[workflow]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
# Split into directory and stem for the gate script:
OUTDIR="$(dirname "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/qual/scholar-qual-[workflow]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
STEM="$(basename "${OUTPUT_ROOT}/[slug]/qual/scholar-qual-[workflow]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD]")"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
bash "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/version-check.sh" "$OUTDIR" "$STEM"
```

**Use the printed `SAVE_PATH` as `file_path` in the Write tool call.** Re-run this block (with the appropriate BASE) for each additional file. The same version suffix must be used for all related output files (.md, .docx, .tex, .pdf).

**Filename convention:**
`scholar-qual-[workflow]-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

- `[workflow]`: codebook, open-coding, axial, selective, thematic, content, llm-coding, mixed, reliability
- `[topic-slug]`: first 4-6 significant words of the topic, lowercased, hyphenated
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]`: today's date

**File header:**
```
# Scholar Qualitative Analysis: [workflow name] — [topic]
*Generated by /scholar-qual on [YYYY-MM-DD]*

---
```

After saving, tell the user:
> Output saved to `[filename]`

**Close Process Log:**

Run the following to finalize the process log:

```bash
OUTPUT_ROOT="${OUTPUT_ROOT:-output}"
SKILL_NAME="scholar-qual"
LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LOG_FILE="${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
  LOG_FILE=$(ls -t ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/logs/process-log-${SKILL_NAME}-${LOG_DATE}*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
cat >> "$LOG_FILE" << LOGFOOTER

## Output Files
[list each output file path as a bullet]
