A Claude Code project for social scientists writing for top-tier journals. Covers the full research pipeline from literature synthesis to submission-ready manuscripts.

Built for **Claude Code**, but not locked to it: the skills are plain-markdown instruction folders that **OpenAI Codex** and other coding agents can load too. Link them into `~/.codex/skills` and invoke them in natural language ("Use scholar-idea to sharpen this research question"). The data-safety layer travels with the host — `/scholar-init` installs the same PreToolUse guard as a Codex hook in `<project>/.codex/config.toml` (see [Data Safety](#data-safety-v590)).

> **If you use open-scholar-skill, please cite [Zhang (2026), *Chinese Sociological Review*](https://doi.org/10.1080/21620555.2026.2707167).** See the [Citation](#citation) section below for the full reference and BibTeX (an arXiv preprint is also available).

## Ethical Use of AI in Academic Research

Open-scholar-skill is designed to **assist** researchers, not replace them. If you use this tool in your research, we strongly encourage the following practices:

1. **Disclose AI usage.** Many journals now require or recommend AI use declarations. Be transparent about how you used AI tools in your research process — whether for literature review, drafting, data analysis, or citation management. The `/scholar-ethics` skill can generate journal-specific AI disclosure statements for you.

2. **Verify all outputs.** AI-generated content can contain errors, hallucinations, and fabricated citations. Always independently verify statistical results, check that cited references actually exist, and critically evaluate any AI-drafted prose before submission. The `/scholar-verify` and `/scholar-citation verify` skills provide automated checks, but human judgment remains essential.

3. **Maintain intellectual ownership.** You are the researcher. Use these tools to accelerate your workflow, not to outsource your thinking. The research questions, theoretical arguments, and interpretations should reflect your expertise and scholarly judgment.

4. **Protect participant privacy with mechanical enforcement.** Reading a data file through Claude Code transmits its contents to the Anthropic API. For restricted datasets, HIPAA-covered records, IRB-protected interviews, or any file with personally identifying information, silent transmission is unacceptable. v5.9.0 introduces a three-layer data-safety stack (policy → ingestion-time scan → PreToolUse hook) that requires an explicit researcher decision on every data file before any skill can Read it. Start with `/scholar-init` to stand up a project; see the [Data Safety](#data-safety-v590) section below for the full story.

### A Note on the Full-Paper Orchestrator

This open-source release intentionally **does not include** `scholar-full-paper` (an end-to-end orchestrator that chains all skills into a single command), `scholar-grant`, `scholar-teach`, `scholar-book`, or `scholar-presentation`. The first four were removed to discourage fully automated paper generation without meaningful researcher involvement. `scholar-presentation` was removed due to copyright concerns with consulting-firm slide aesthetics.

It **does** include `scholar-auto-research`, a stable, deterministic pipeline that chains the modular skills from idea or data to a verified manuscript — but **this is not autonomous research, and we do not endorse using it as such.** It differs from the orchestrators above in three ways that are designed to keep you in control: (1) a mandatory **human-in-the-loop mode** that stops for your explicit approval between phases (`set-mode human-in-loop`); (2) deterministic, auditable gates at every phase — results locks, citation-metadata verification, four-agent manuscript verification, and a journal-calibrated quality review — that surface what to inspect rather than hide it; and (3) a hard rule that the specialist skills (`scholar-write`, `scholar-citation`, `scholar-respond`, …) do the substantive scholarly work, so no helper script silently becomes the author of your argument, literature synthesis, or citations. **You remain the author of the research question, the argument, and every interpretation.** Run it in autonomous mode only when you will independently verify every output it produces — the same standard as point 2 in [Ethical Use](#ethical-use-of-ai-in-academic-research) above. When in doubt, run the skills individually and stay in the loop at every step.

The 34 modular skills provided here are the same building blocks. You are encouraged to build your own workflow by chaining skills in the order that fits your research process. A typical pipeline looks like:

```
/scholar-init (set up project + data safety)
    →  /scholar-idea  →  /scholar-brainstorm (or /scholar-conceptual)
    →  /scholar-lit-review (or /scholar-lit-review-hypothesis)
    →  /scholar-hypothesis  →  /scholar-design
    →  /scholar-causal  →  /scholar-data  →  /scholar-safety
    →  /scholar-eda  →  /scholar-analyze  →  /scholar-compute (if needed)
    →  /scholar-qual (if qualitative)  →  /scholar-ling (if sociolinguistic)
    →  /scholar-write  →  /scholar-citation  →  /scholar-verify
    →  /scholar-journal  →  /scholar-open  →  /scholar-replication
    →  /scholar-ethics  →  /scholar-code-review
    →  /scholar-respond (simulate review)  →  revise and submit
```

Not every project needs every skill. Skip what doesn't apply, repeat what does (`/scholar-write` → `/scholar-verify` → revise → repeat). Running each skill individually keeps you in the loop at every stage — reviewing outputs, making decisions, and steering the research direction. This is how we believe AI tools should be used in scholarship.

## Data Safety (v5.9.0)

The "keep researchers in the loop" philosophy applies to data access just as much as to paper drafting. Reading a data file through Claude Code transmits its contents to the Anthropic API — silent for a public CSV, potentially a data-use-agreement violation for NHANES, PSID, NLSY, Census RDC, HIPAA-covered records, or IRB-protected interviews. v5.9.0 addresses this with a three-layer defense that requires an explicit researcher decision on every data file.

**Layer 1 — Policy.** `.claude/skills/_shared/data-handling-policy.md` defines five `SAFETY_STATUS` values (`CLEARED`, `LOCAL_MODE`, `ANONYMIZED`, `OVERRIDE`, `HALTED`) and the LOCAL_MODE execution contract: bash-only `Rscript -e` / `python3 -c` heredocs, never `Read`, with a forbidden-verb list (`head(df)`, `print(df)`, `df.head()`, `df.sample()`, etc.).

**Layer 2 — Ingestion-time scan.** `/scholar-init` is a new interactive skill that creates a standardized project layout, copies raw files into `data/raw/`, runs a local PII/HIPAA scan on each, and writes `.claude/safety-status.json`. Its `review` mode walks the researcher through every `NEEDS_REVIEW` entry and resolves it to an explicit status. This is the "slow down and decide" half of the stack — maximum in-the-loop behavior, exactly in the spirit of this release.

**Layer 3 — Mechanical enforcement.** `scripts/gates/pretooluse-data-guard.sh` is intended for global registration as a PreToolUse hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`. It intercepts every `Read`, `NotebookRead`, `NotebookEdit`, `Grep`, and `Glob` call, looks up the target path in the nearest `.claude/safety-status.json`, and refuses the call when the status is `NEEDS_REVIEW:*` or `HALTED`. Qualitative audio/video/transcript formats cannot be `OVERRIDE`'d even via a hand-edited sidecar. Paths that canonicalize into system directories (`/etc`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/System`, `/var/db`, `/var/log`, `/private/*`) are refused outright. The hook also covers two channels that used to be open: a **Bash** dump-verb gate (blocks `cat`/`head`/`sed`/`awk`/`grep`-rows/`sqlite3`/python·R row dumps of sensitive paths while allowing the sanctioned LOCAL_MODE aggregate loaders) and an **Edit/Write** guard that prevents tampering with `.claude/safety-status.json`. An optional **strict** level adds a PostToolUse hook that redacts PII / bulk-row Bash *output* before it reaches the model — set the level with `/scholar-safety level <standard|strict|lockdown>`.

**Layer 3 under a Codex host.** That hook is a Claude Code mechanism; a **Codex** host never reads `~/.claude/settings.json`. So when `/scholar-init` detects a Codex (or unknown) host it *also* installs the same guard as a Codex PreToolUse hook — a `[hooks.PreToolUse]` block in `<project>/.codex/config.toml` running `scripts/gates/codex-pretooluse-hook.sh`, which delegates to the very same guard and returns Codex's deny wire on a blocked read (verified end-to-end against `codex`). It activates once you **trust the project** in Codex; until then the project's `AGENTS.md` block instructs the agent to self-enforce against the sidecar.

**Layer 3 lockdown — the OS wall (both hosts).** The hook and prose above are *cooperative* guardrails. For a kernel-enforced boundary that stops even a determined or prompt-injected agent, `/scholar-safety level lockdown` runs `scripts/gates/generate-lockdown-config.sh`, which writes an OS-sandbox read-deny on the data dirs for the detected host: Claude Code gets `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` in `.claude/settings.json` (Seatbelt/Landlock); Codex gets a `[permissions]` `"data"="deny"` profile in `.codex/config.toml`. Verified end-to-end — a sandboxed `cat data/raw/*.csv` returns `Operation not permitted`, 0 leak, on both. Lockdown is a hard wall by default (`allowUnsandboxedCommands:false`), so it also blocks the sanctioned LOCAL_MODE analysis — run analysis before locking, or pass `--allow-escalation` for a human-approved escape hatch.

**Typical quickstart:**

```
bash scripts/init-project.sh --dest ~/research nhanes-bmi ~/Downloads/nhanes.csv
cd ~/research/nhanes-bmi
/scholar-init review                      # resolve each NEEDS_REVIEW entry
/scholar-eda data/raw/nhanes.csv          # proceeds under the sidecar-recorded status
/scholar-analyze ...                      # inherits the same decisions
```

**The eleven data-touching skills gated by this stack**: `scholar-analyze`, `scholar-eda`, `scholar-compute`, `scholar-ling`, `scholar-qual`, `scholar-brainstorm` (Tier A — LOCAL_MODE dispatch); `scholar-data`, `scholar-verify`, `scholar-replication`, `scholar-code-review`, `scholar-write` (Tier B — sidecar check + fail-fast refusal).

**Enabling mechanical enforcement.** `setup.sh` automatically registers `scripts/gates/pretooluse-data-guard.sh` (and, at the strict level, `posttooluse-output-guard.sh`) as hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, with the matcher covering `Read`, `NotebookRead`, `NotebookEdit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash`, `Edit`, and `Write`. `jq` and `python3` are required on the host; the read-channel guard fails closed without either (the Bash/Edit/Write speed-bumps fail open so the shell is never bricked). Two activation gotchas: (1) Claude Code snapshots hook config at session **start**, so you must **restart** Claude Code after install for the hooks to take effect; (2) Claude Code runs a hook `command` as a shell line, so on installs whose path contains spaces (e.g. Google Drive) the command must be wrapped as `bash '<path>'` — `setup.sh` does this for you, but a hand-edited settings file must too, or the guard silently fails open for *all* tools.

### ⚠️ Honest limitations — this is risk reduction, not a guarantee

**Be aware: the current data-safety stack is NOT the ideal or safest possible design.** It is a *researcher-in-the-loop guardrail* that makes accidental and casual leakage hard — it is **not a containment boundary against a determined or prompt-injected agent.** Specifically:

- The **Bash** gate is a best-effort denylist. Arbitrary shell cannot be fully vetted: other interpreters (`ruby`, `node`, `perl`), output encodings (`base64`/`gzip`/`hex`), variable-assembled paths, or copying a sensitive file to a benign path and then reading the copy can still move data into context. The PostToolUse **strict** redactor narrows the output channel but is likewise evadable by encoding.
- The hook is a tool-name allowlist, not an OS sandbox. It cannot stop a subprocess that opens a file directly, and it does not govern third-party tools you invoke from your own scripts.
- For genuinely restricted data (DUA/IRB/HIPAA), treat these guards as defense-in-depth on top of — never a replacement for — institutional controls.

**The OS-level sandbox (`lockdown`) is the real boundary.** As described above, `/scholar-safety level lockdown` writes a kernel-enforced `denyRead` on the data directories (`allowUnsandboxedCommands:false`) so the agent physically cannot read raw data except through an explicit, user-approved escalation (`--allow-escalation`). That is the only configuration that stops a determined agent; the `standard` and `strict` levels do not.

**Strongest mitigation available right now: work on synthetic data.** Rather than exposing real sensitive data to any AI tool, generate a **synthetic dataset with the full variable set** — same column names, types, value ranges, and (optionally) joint distributions as the real data, but no real records — and point the skills at that. The agent can build and debug the entire analysis pipeline against the synthetic file; you then run the finished, reviewed scripts against the real data **locally**, outside the AI tool, so real records never enter any model's context. This sidesteps the guards' limitations entirely and is the recommended workflow for DUA/IRB-restricted datasets — a complement to `lockdown`, not a substitute: even with the OS sandbox enabled, keeping real records out of any model's context is the strongest posture.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `peer-reviewer-quant` | Methodologist: evaluates design, identification, robustness |
| `peer-reviewer-theory` | Theorist: evaluates framework, hypotheses, literature |

| `verify-figures` | Raw figure files vs. manuscript figure descriptions and captions |
| `verify-logic` | Statistical claims in prose traced back to tables/figures — catches misquoted numbers, significance errors |
| `verify-completeness` | Full artifact chain integrity — orphaned/missing items, numbering, cross-references |
| `verify-claim-faithfulness` | Sentence-level check that each cited source actually supports the claim attributed to it — catches misattribution, reversed direction, magnitude overclaim, scope overgeneralization |

### Code Review Agents (used by `scholar-code-review`)

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `review-code-correctness` | Logic errors, off-by-one, wrong merge keys, silent NaN propagation |
| `review-code-robustness` | Edge cases, input validation, defensive coding |
| `review-code-statistics` | Statistical implementation fidelity — correct method, correct specification |
| `review-code-reproducibility` | Seed setting, path portability, dependency management |
| `review-code-style` | AI-generated anti-patterns, hallucinated functions, over-engineering |
| `review-code-data-handling` | Miscoded categories, wrong recodes, mishandled missing values, sample restrictions |

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo> && cd open-scholar-skill
bash setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` will:
1. Create symlinks (`skills/` → `.claude/skills/`, `agents/` → `.claude/agents/`)
2. Auto-detect your Zotero library (or prompt for path)
3. Optionally configure BibTeX, EndNote, and CrossRef email
4. Install all 35 skills + 20 agents as **personal skills** in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/agents/` — installed per-entry alongside any existing personal skills
5. Register the PreToolUse data-safety hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` (idempotent; preserves existing settings)
6. Check for `jq` and `python3` (required by the data-safety hook)
7. Write a `.env` file with your configuration

**Requirements:** `bash`, `python3`, `jq`. The data-safety hook fails closed if `jq` or `python3` is missing, so install both first (`brew install jq` / `apt-get install jq`). Presidio (optional, for NER-based PII detection) is installed via `python3 -m pip install presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer`.

After setup, all `/scholar-*` commands work from any directory.

## Setting Up the Article Library (for `scholar-write`)

The `scholar-write` skill uses example articles to calibrate writing voice and style. The asset directory ships empty — you populate it with your own papers and exemplars from your target journals.

### Step 1: Add your own papers

Copy your published PDFs into:
```
.claude/skills/scholar-write/assets/example-articles/
```
These teach the skill your personal writing voice — how you frame puzzles, state contributions, and structure arguments.

### Step 2: Add top-journal exemplars (optional but recommended)

Create the directory and add exemplar papers from your target journals:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/scholar-write/assets/top-journal-articles/
```
Copy 5–20 recent papers from journals you target (e.g., ASR, AJS, Demography, Science Advances). These teach the skill the structural depth, citation density, and rigor level each journal expects.

### Step 3: Build the index and knowledge base

Once you've added PDFs, ask Claude Code to index them for you:

```
Scan all PDFs in .claude/skills/scholar-write/assets/example-articles/ and
.claude/skills/scholar-write/assets/top-journal-articles/. For each paper,
use pdftotext to extract the first 300 lines, then populate:
1. assets/index.md — add a row per paper (filename, citation, journal, method, topics, best-for)
2. assets/article-knowledge-base.md — add a structured entry per paper (opening line, gap sentence, contribution claim, voice register, sentence architecture, paragraph rhythm)
3. assets/section-snippets.md — extract verbatim quotes into the 9 rhetorical categories (opening hooks, gap statements, contribution claims, mechanism statements, data description openings, results lead-ins, discussion openers, limitation acknowledgments, closing sentences)
```

This one prompt builds the entire knowledge base automatically from your PDFs.

> **Note:** `scholar-write` works without any articles — it will draft sections using its built-in knowledge of journal conventions. The article library makes the output better by calibrating to your voice and your target journal's norms.

## Setting Up `scholar-monitor` (phone digests via ntfy or Telegram)

`scholar-monitor` watches your chosen journals + arXiv categories and pushes digests of new papers to your phone. This section walks through setup end to end: bootstrap → pick sources → test fetch → wire up phone push → schedule under `/loop`.

Everything persists under `~/.claude/scholar-monitor/` — user-scoped, shared across all projects, independent of any single repo.

### Step 1: Bootstrap the state directory

```
/scholar-monitor init
```

This creates `~/.claude/scholar-monitor/` with:
- `sources.json` — 22 starter sources (ASR, AJS, Demography, arXiv cs.CL, etc.), three enabled by default (ASR, arxiv-llm, NHB) so first-run digests stay small
- `state.json` — empty cursor file (per-source last-seen watermarks)
- `config.json` — delivery channel settings (`chmod 0600`)
- `archive.ndjson` — append-only digest history

You're done with setup; the skill will fetch into the file channel immediately. Phone push requires a few more steps below.

### Step 2: Pick the journals and preprint queries you care about

```
/scholar-monitor list
```

Shows all 22 sources with their enabled/disabled state, cadence (how often to check), and next-due date. To enable more journals or change cadence, edit `~/.claude/scholar-monitor/sources.json` directly — it's a plain JSON registry. See `references/registry-guide.md` in this repo for the ISSN lookup table (covers 28 sociology/demography/interdisciplinary journals) and the arXiv category list.

To add a custom journal or arXiv query without editing JSON by hand:

```
/scholar-monitor add
```

which prompts you for backend type, identifier (ISSN for journals, arXiv query string for preprints), category label, and cadence.

### Step 3: Test the fetch pipeline (no phone push yet)

```
/scholar-monitor preview          # dry-run: show what would fetch, no network, no state change
/scholar-monitor arxiv-llm         # real fetch from one source, writes output/monitor/feed-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Open the feed file. If it has paper entries with titles, authors, dates, and 2–3-sentence summaries, the fetcher works. Now wire up a push channel.

### Step 4a: Phone push via **ntfy.sh** (recommended — zero auth, 5 minutes)

ntfy is a free push service with no accounts. You pick a secret topic string, subscribe to it on your phone, and `scholar-monitor` POSTs notifications to that topic.

**On your phone:**

1. Install the **ntfy** app (iOS App Store / Google Play — published by Philipp Heckel).
2. Open the app → tap **+** → paste a random topic string (see next step) → **Subscribe**.

**On your computer:**

```bash
# Generate an unguessable topic. Anyone who knows this string can push to your
# phone, so save it somewhere like a password manager, and treat it as a secret.
openssl rand -hex 8
# → e.g., b4ab8afe7e06d2ef
```

Subscribe to that same string on your phone (the **+** step above), then:

```
/scholar-monitor configure delivery
```

When prompted, paste the topic string. You can skip the Telegram and email prompts. That's it — next time `/scholar-monitor` fetches papers, you'll get a push notification within seconds of the run.

**Test push:**

```
/scholar-monitor arxiv-llm
```

Your phone should buzz with a notification titled "scholar-monitor — N new papers." If it doesn't, check: (1) the ntfy app has the exact topic string subscribed, (2) iOS/Android notification permissions are enabled for the ntfy app, (3) the topic in `~/.claude/scholar-monitor/config.json` matches exactly.

**ntfy free tier limits:** 250 messages/day per IP — more than enough for a daily digest. For higher volume or custom domains, see [ntfy.sh self-hosting](https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/).

### Step 4b: Phone push via **Telegram** (alternative — more setup, two-way support)

Telegram delivery is more work to set up but gives you a two-way chat channel (you can reply to digests and, if you use other Claude Code Telegram plugins, interact with Claude remotely).

**Prerequisites:**

1. A Telegram account + the Telegram mobile app installed.
2. The Claude Code Telegram MCP plugin installed in your Claude Code environment (this is separate from scholar-monitor).

**Setup:**

1. **Create a bot.** In Telegram, message `@BotFather`, run `/newbot`, name your bot, and save the token (`123456:ABC-DEF...`).
2. **Configure the plugin.** In a Claude Code session, run the configuration command for your Telegram plugin (typically `/telegram:configure`) and paste the bot token when prompted.
3. **Find your chat ID.** Message your bot once from your phone. The plugin's allowlist management command (typically `/telegram:access`) will show the pending pairing with your `chat_id`. Approve it.
4. **Wire it into scholar-monitor.**
   ```
   /scholar-monitor configure delivery
   ```
   When prompted, paste the `chat_id` from step 3.

**Test:**

```
/scholar-monitor arxiv-llm
```

You'll receive a Telegram message from your bot with the digest summary in the message body and the full `feed-YYYY-MM-DD.md` attached as a document.

**Heads-up:** the Telegram MCP plugin is a moving part — if it disconnects mid-session, scholar-monitor logs the failure and continues (the file channel and knowledge-graph ingest still run). For headless `/loop` scheduling that doesn't depend on a running MCP plugin, ntfy is more reliable.

### Step 4c (optional): Email via SMTP

Heaviest setup of the three. Requires SMTP credentials (Gmail App Password recommended; see [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)).

```
/scholar-monitor configure delivery
```

When prompted, provide SMTP host (`smtp.gmail.com`), port (`587`), from/to addresses, and the env-var name holding the password (default `SMTP_PASS`). Then in your shell or `.env`:

```bash
export SMTP_PASS="your-16-char-app-password"
```

The password lives only in the env var, never in `config.json`.

### Step 5: Schedule with `/loop`

Once a push channel is working, automate:

```
/loop 24h /scholar-monitor arxiv-llm     # daily arXiv LLM digest
/loop 7d  /scholar-monitor                # weekly sweep of every enabled source
/loop 1h  /scholar-monitor                # harmless — per-source cadence_days drops redundant ticks
```

The `cadence_days` filter in each source ensures idempotency: running `/loop 1h` with a source on a weekly cadence produces **one** digest per week, not 168. Per-source failures (network errors) don't advance that source's cursor, so the next tick retries cleanly.

### Verifying the setup

```
/scholar-monitor status
```

Prints a dashboard: enabled source count, archive size, which delivery channels are configured, and any overdue sources. A healthy setup shows at least one channel beyond `file`, zero errors, and sources with next-due dates in the near future.

If something's off, `~/.claude/scholar-monitor/logs/deliver-YYYY-MM-DD.log` captures per-channel delivery attempts — that's where ntfy HTTP errors or SMTP auth failures land.
