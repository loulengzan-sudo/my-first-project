# Detects whether the current working directory is a scholar-init project,
# validates that every file in .claude/safety-status.json has been resolved
# (no NEEDS_REVIEW entries), creates the output/<slug>/ tree directly

# Step -1.0 dispatches on its exit code:
#
#   0 — handshake fired; caller should advance directly to Phase 0
#   1 — HALT: unresolved NEEDS_REVIEW entries, malformed safety-status.json,
#       or missing jq. Caller should exit the skill entirely.
#   2 — not a scholar-init project; caller should fall through to legacy
#       Phase -1 flow (creates output/_staging/...)
#
# The script is idempotent on priority 0 (reentry): if project-state.md
# already has phase entries, the handshake appends a "Re-Entry" note
# instead of clobbering accumulated state.
