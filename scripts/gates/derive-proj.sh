# derive-proj.sh — single source of truth for the ${PROJ} path.
#
# Every phase of an orchestrated run (scholar-auto-research and any other
# multi-phase caller) needs to write to the project-scoped output directory
# (`output/<slug>/`). Shell variables do NOT persist across Bash tool calls (per
# the repo's CLAUDE.md rule), so every Bash block has to re-derive PROJ. This
# helper is the canonical derivation logic — sourcing it replaces the legacy
#     PROJ="${PROJ:-output/_staging}"
# one-liner that defaulted every phase to a staging directory and silently
# broke the handshake from scholar-init into the pipeline.
#
# Usage (inside any Bash block in a SKILL.md or reference file):
#     . "${SCHOLAR_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/gates/derive-proj.sh"
#     # PROJ is now set; use ${PROJ}/tables, ${PROJ}/logs, etc.
#
# Priority order:
#   1. If PROJ is already exported in the environment → keep it.
#   2. Existing project-state.md under output/<slug>/logs/ → use that slug.
#   3. scholar-init handshake context (.claude/safety-status.json + data/raw/)
#      → use basename(pwd) as slug and return output/<slug>.
#   4. Legacy fallback → output/_staging.
#
# This file is `source`d, not executed. It MUST NOT `exit`.
