# PreToolUse hook — data-file safety guard.
#
# Claude Code calls this script before every tool invocation. It reads the
# hook payload from stdin (JSON with tool_name, tool_input, cwd, ...) and
# decides whether to allow or block the call.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Inspects tool_name ∈ {Read, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, Grep, Glob,
#     Bash, Edit, Write, MultiEdit}. Any other tool passes through.
#     (REQUIRES the ~/.claude/settings.json PreToolUse matcher to list these
#     tools; the matcher is snapshotted at session start, so a matcher edit
#     only takes effect after the Claude Code session is restarted.)
#   - For Read / NotebookRead / NotebookEdit:
#     * Extracts the file_path (or notebook_path) argument.
#     * Canonicalizes it via realpath (resolves symlinks + relative segments).
#     * Checks if the extension is a data-file type. Non-data files pass.
#     * Checks the sidecar <cwd>/.claude/safety-status.json — honors
#       CLEARED/ANONYMIZED/OVERRIDE as allow; LOCAL_MODE/HALTED/
#       NEEDS_REVIEW:* as block.
#     * For image files, applies path-based classification (raw-data
#       directories → block; output/screenshot paths → allow).
#     * For other data files, delegates to safety-scan.sh.
#   - For Grep / Glob:
#     * Extracts the path/pattern argument.
#     * If it targets a raw-data directory segment, blocks the call
#       (Grep would return matching lines from sensitive files into
#       Claude's context, which is exactly what the guard must prevent).
#   - For Bash (Standard-tier SPEED-BUMP, see §2d):
#     * Parses tool_input.command, finds path tokens that resolve to a
#       sensitive data target (is_rawdata_path / is_qual_path / sidecar
#       LOCAL_MODE|HALTED|NEEDS_REVIEW), and blocks obvious content-dump
#       commands (cat/head/sed/awk/grep-rows/sqlite3/python|R row dumps).
#     * NOT a containment boundary — arbitrary shell can bypass it (other
#       interpreters, encodings, var-assembled paths). It FAILS OPEN on any
#       ambiguity so the shell is never bricked. The real wall is the OS
#       sandbox configured by the Lockdown safety level.
#   - For Edit / Write / MultiEdit:
#     * Passes through instantly UNLESS the target is .claude/safety-status.json,
#       in which case it blocks a CLEARED/OVERRIDE promotion of a restricted
#       file that lacks /scholar-init review provenance. Also fails OPEN.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code hook semantics):
#   0 → allow the tool call
#   2 → block; stderr is surfaced to Claude as the refusal reason
#
# Bypass: there is no env-var bypass. To override a single file, write
# {"path": "OVERRIDE"} into <cwd>/.claude/safety-status.json. To disable
# globally, remove the hook from ~/.claude/settings.json.

# ─── 2c. Hard-require python3 for gated tools ──────────────────────────

SAFETY GUARD: $TOOL_NAME blocked.

python3 is not available on this system. The data-safety guard uses
python3 as its primary path canonicalizer — without it, pathological
paths containing '..' segments with nonexistent intermediate components
can evade the project-root and sensitive-directory classifiers.

Every other layer of the open-scholar-skills data-safety pipeline
(safety-scan.sh, scholar-init, the presidio anonymizer) also requires
python3. Install it before using the plugin:

  macOS:  xcode-select --install       (XCode CLT ships python3 in /usr/bin)
          brew install python          (Homebrew alternative)
  Linux:  apt-get install python3      (or dnf / pacman / apk)

Non-gated tool calls (Bash, Edit, Write, …) are unaffected.

  # (3) VARIABLE-EXPANSION pass. Resolve $VAR / ${VAR} against assignments made
  #     in THIS SAME command, plus a small allowlist of ambient environment
  #     variables, and emit the fully-literal result. Purely ADDITIVE (same
  #     contract as pass 1): it only ever adds concrete tokens, so it can never
  #     turn a previously-blocked command into an allowed one.
  #
  #     WHY: the classifier skips any token containing '$' (it cannot resolve
  #     one), so a sensitive path reached through a variable slipped the gate
  #     entirely — `SP=/abs/proj; grep x "$SP/corpus/transcripts/i.txt"` was not
  #     caught at all, and `D=data; cat "$D/raw/x.csv"` was missed because the
  #     bare RHS `data` is not itself a sensitive path. (`D=data/raw;
  #     cat "$D/x.csv"` was caught only by accident, via the RHS token.)
  #
  #     Why intra-command assignments are the right scope: Claude Code starts a
  #     FRESH shell for every Bash call, so shell variables do not persist. A
  #     variable that is neither assigned in the same command nor an exported
  #     env var expands to empty at runtime and cannot address a real file.
  #     Expanded tokens are concrete paths, so the existence gate still applies
  #     to them — this closes the hole without reopening the false positives.

  #     expression), which is not a path; and the historical pass below shreds
  #     `/a b/…` at the space. So a SENSITIVE PATH WITH A SPACE, quoted INSIDE
  #     the code argument, was yielded by NO pass. `bash_first_sensitive_target`
  #     came back empty and the Bash arm exited 0 before `bash_command_is_dump`
  #     was ever consulted — even though that dump regex DOES match
  #     `print(head(d))` and `.head(` (verified: the identical command with a

# Does a candidate token correspond to something that ACTUALLY EXISTS on disk
# (file OR directory), or — for a glob token — to an existing directory prefix?
#
# WHY existence is consulted here, and ONLY here: this is a READ gate. A dump
# verb aimed at a path that does not exist reveals zero bytes, so declining to
# classify nonexistent tokens cannot open a data-leak bypass. What it DOES
# remove is the large false-positive class where a token merely LOOKS like a
# sensitive path without being a file operand at all — a regex handed to grep
# (`grep -n "data/raw|materials/" script.sh`), a literal inside a for-loop, or
# an example path in a heredoc. Those were blocked purely because the command
# text contained a path-shaped string next to a dump verb.
#
# TWO RULES THAT MUST NOT BE RELAXED — each one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. file OR DIRECTORY, never file-only. `D=data/raw; cat "$D/x.csv"` is
#      caught solely because the assignment-RHS token `data/raw` is an existing
#      DIRECTORY — the `$D/x.csv` token is skipped for containing `$`. A
#      file-only existence test would silently turn that regression-locked
#      BLOCK (test-pretooluse-guard.sh "Bash var-assembled (S2)") into a real
#      bypass.
#
#   2. glob tokens are REWRITTEN to their literal directory prefix by the
#      caller before they reach here (see bash_first_sensitive_target), because
#      a glob can only reach files underneath that prefix. `data/raw/*.csv`
#      becomes `data/raw`, which exists and is sensitive. Do NOT reintroduce a
#      glob fallback in this function: testing "some existing ancestor" instead
#      of the literal prefix makes a token like `*/raw/*` resolve to the
#      current directory, which trivially exists — and then the pattern itself
#      gets reported as a sensitive target.
#
# Residual (documented, accepted): TOCTOU — a path that does not exist when the
# hook runs but does by the time the command executes. Consistent with this
# gate's stated scope as a cooperative-agent speed-bump, not a containment wall.

The command uses a content-revealing mechanism (cat/head/tail/sed/awk/grep/
sqlite3 or a python/R row dump) on that path. Reading row-level data via Bash
transmits it to the API exactly as the Read tool would.

Do this instead:
  - Aggregates only: one Rscript -e / python3 -c call that prints summaries
    (nrow, names+classes, summary(), table() with n<10 suppressed) — see
    _shared/data-handling-policy.md §3a/§3b.
  - Counts: 'wc -l <file>'  or  'grep -c PATTERN <file>'.

If that token is NOT a file you are reading — e.g. it is a regex handed to
grep, or a literal inside a loop — then this is a false positive: the token is
classified by path shape, not by its position in the command. Rewrite the
pattern so it does not spell a real sensitive path (split it, drop the trailing
slash, or match on a distinctive substring instead).

NOTE: this Bash gate is a cooperative-agent SPEED-BUMP, not a containment wall.

The sidecar marks this file SAFETY_STATUS=OVERRIDE, but it is classified
as qualitative data — either by extension ('.$EXT' is audio/video/
interview transcript) or by path (lives under transcripts/, interviews/,
field-notes/, participants/, subjects/, respondents/, or a materials/
subtree for those). Policy §4 forbids OVERRIDE on qualitative data:

  - Audio files contain voiceprints (biometric PII)
  - Video files contain identifying faces and voices
  - Interview transcripts quote participants verbatim
  - Field notes and open-ended responses quote participants verbatim

There is no rationale under which this file is "safe to transmit." Only
three resolutions are valid for qualitative data:

  LOCAL_MODE  — Claude analyzes via Rscript/python3 without reading
                the file; only aggregated output enters context.
  ANONYMIZED  — run scholar-qual's presidio anonymizer first, then
                treat the ANON_ output as CLEARED.
  HALTED      — do not process this file at all.

Fix: edit ${STATUS_FILE} and change the entry for this file from
"OVERRIDE" to one of the three statuses above.

(initial scan level: ${LVL}).

Before Claude is allowed to Read this file, the user must run:

  /scholar-init review

…which walks through each NEEDS_REVIEW entry interactively and replaces
it with CLEARED, LOCAL_MODE, ANONYMIZED, OVERRIDE, or HALTED.

This is an image file in a raw-data directory. safety-scan.sh cannot
inspect pixel content for faces, license plates, street signs, medical
imagery, or other identifying visuals, so image Reads from raw-data
directories are blocked by default.

If this image is a public / fully-aggregated output, add an OVERRIDE
entry to .claude/safety-status.json:
  jq --arg fp "$FILE_PATH" '. + {(\$fp): "OVERRIDE"}' \\
     .claude/safety-status.json > .claude/safety-status.json.new \\
     && mv .claude/safety-status.json.new .claude/safety-status.json

If this image contains people, documents, or private locations, DO NOT
override. Process it via a Python script that emits only aggregates:
  - Face detection → emit counts / bounding-box sizes / de-identified embeddings
  - OCR → redact detected PII, save a redacted copy, then Read the copy
  - CLIP/DINOv2/ConvNeXt → emit label counts or pooled features

$DETAIL

This file appears to contain PII, HIPAA-covered, restricted-use, or other
sensitive content. Reading it via the Read tool would transmit row-level
data to the Anthropic API.

DO NOT retry this Read. Instead:

  1. Switch to LOCAL_MODE. Load the file inside a single Rscript -e
     (or python3 -c) Bash call and print only aggregated output:
     see _shared/data-handling-policy.md §3a / §3b.

  2. If this is a false positive, add an OVERRIDE entry to
     .claude/safety-status.json with a typed rationale logged verbatim
     to logs/init-report.md.

  3. To anonymize first, use scripts/gates/anonymize-presidio.py.
